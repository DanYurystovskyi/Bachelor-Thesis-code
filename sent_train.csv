"The Euro was able to appreciate particularly significantly against the Swiss Franc yesterday, but also against the Swedish Krona. Economists at Commerzbank expect the shared currency to thrive amid attractiveECBmonetary policy. Euro as a European outperformer “The many hawkish comments across the typical dove and hawk camps within the ECB seem to have made a difference. If the ECB stands by its comments, its immediate monetary policy direction is likely to be quite attractive.” “Between ‘possibly not quite determined enough’ and ‘“already foreseeably successful’ the ECB is currently occupying a sweet spot by European comparison, in which the Euro is able to benefit from the ECB's pronounced hawkish determination.” ",1
"EUR/CHF yesterday broke above 1.00. Economists at ING had been forecasting a lower EUR/CHF this year and now they will have to revise up the forecast. Race higher may stall in the 1.0070/1.0100 area “Given that it looks like the Dollar will stay offered for the time being and theECBlooks unlikely to relent on its hawkishness, this trend to a higher EUR/CHF may remain in place. However, we doubt the SNB would want to see a big rally this early and the move may stall in the 1.0070/1.0100 area.” “We had thought EUR/CHF could trade to 0.95 this summer, but it looks like we will have to revise up those forecasts.” ",1
EUR/CHF climbs back above parity. Economists at MUFG Bank believe that the pair could climb as high as 1.04. SNB is becoming more tolerant of a weaker CHF “The SNB has confirmed that it has been intervening to support the Franc recently to prevent a sharper move lower from reinforcing upside inflation risks. Yesterday’s move higher could then encourage speculation that the SNB is becoming less concerned by upside inflation risks and more tolerant of a weaker CHF.” “The favourable growth developments should encourage theECBto keep tightening policy at a faster pace at upcoming policy meetings when we expect the policy rate to reach 3.00% by the end of Q1. It leaves room for EUR/CHF to extend its advance back to levels recorded in the 1H of last year when it was trading between 1.0200 and 1.0400.” ,1
EUR/CHF has broken out above the sideways range since October affirming extension in up move. Economists at Société Générale expect the pair to extend its advance. 0.9970/0.9950 to be important support near term “The pair is expected to head higher gradually towards 1.0130 and projections of 1.0240/1.0260; this could be an interim resistance zone.” “Upper end of previous consolidation zone and the 200-Day Moving Average at 0.9970/0.9950 is likely to be an important support near term.” See:EUR/CHF could extend its advance back to levels between 1.02 and 1.04 – MUFG ,1
"Analysts at MUFG Bank have a bullish outlook for the EUR/CHF cross, considering it could benefit from a further scaling back of fears over recession in theEurozone. Key quotes: “After trading within a narrow range between 0.9800 and 0.9950 throughout most of Q4, the pair has broken higher in recent days as it first climbed above the 200-day moving average at 0.9940 and then above parity for the first time since the middle of last year. We expect a further move higher back towards levels that were in place during Q2 of last year between 1.0200 and 1.0500.” “The release today of the latest German GDP data for Q4 has provided further evidence that euro-zone economies are proving more resilient over the winter period.” “Given the CHF’s role as a regional safe haven currency, the CHF should weaken as downside risks in the euro-zone continue to ease. We also believe there is room for EUR/CHF to play catch up with the move higher inEUR/USDsince late last year. TheSNBhas been intervening to support the CHF recently. With inflation pressure globally and in Switzerland now easing, the SNB could become more tolerant of allowing the CHF to weaken somewhat.”",1
"The USDCHF is sharply higher on the day helped by a run up in the EURCHF as well. From a technical perspective, the price was able to move above its 100 bar MA on the 4-hour chart (blue line currently at 0.9278) and continue the upside journey after basing against that MA. The run higher stalled as the price approached the 200 bar MA on the same chart (see green line on the chart). That MA is joined by the 38.2% of the move down from the November 21 high increasing the levels importance. Both the MA and the 38.2% come in at 0.93313. The price has rotated back lower and trades at 0.9311 currently.  That is near the bottom of a swing area between 0.9311 and 0.9325.  Move below and stay below 0.9311 should give the sellers against the upper targets more confidence. With the CPI due out tomorrow, the 100 bar MA at 0.9278 and the 200 bar MA/38.2% retracement at 0.93313 would be the barometers for more bullish/bearish on a surprise one way or another.  Having the price in between makes sense from that perspective ahead of the key release. Let the data tell the technical story, much like the Fed wants to make the data tell the fundamental story for policy in 2023.",1
"The EURCHF is up for the 5th day in a row, after bottoming at 0.98327 last Thursday. The high price today has reached 1.00746. Technically, the price moved above the 200 day MA yesterday at 0.99383 and raced higher. Today, the gain is more modest but the pair is still up 0.6% on the day. The price is up testing/now breaking above the 38.2% at 1.00702. The next target on the daily chart comes in at 1.00977 (call it 1.0100). Get above and it should open the door for more upside momentum. Traders looking for the 2 year trend to be over, would now want to see the 200 day MA to hold any correction. Stay above and the upside can be explored.",1
"New low for the EURUSD as it remains the currency of the day (to the downside). The EUR is the weakest of the majors.  The EURUSD is now down -0.38% . The EURNZD is the weakest of the EUR pairs at -0.92% and is down -0.78% vs the CHF. Looking at the EURCHF, it is also reaching a new low and in the process is retesting its 200 day MA at 0.9936 (see green line on the chart above).  The price moved above the 200 day MA last week for the first time since June 2022. The subsequent run to the upside saw the price extend above the 38.2% of the move down from the March 2021 high at 1.0070, but stalled just ahead of the 1.0100 level, before rotating back to the downside.. So far, the EURCHF is finding support buyers near the 200 day MA. The low price reached just below the level at 0.99346 and currently trades at 0.9942. A move below -with momentum - would give the sellers more confidence. Conversely, holding and the technical longs/buyers from the break above the 200 day MA, can breathe a sigh of relief..",0
"The EUR/CHF pair has climbed back above parity over the past week after bouncing off support for the 200-day moving average at around 0.9930, explained analysts at MUFG Bank. They see that price action supports their view that there is still room for the cross to rise back towards the levels that were in place during the second quarter of last year at closer to the 1.0500-level. Key quotes: “Euro-zone economies are proving more resilient over the winter period, and leadingindicatorssuch as the PMI surveys released over the past week have further dampened recession fears. The warmer winter weather has also meant that natural gas inventories are holding up better than expected in Europe putting additional downward pressure on prices. The favourable developments provide more support for the EUR at the start of this year. Given the CHF’s role as a regional safe haven currency, the CHF should weaken as downside risks in the euro-zone continue to ease.” “We also believe there is room for EUR/CHF to play catch up with the move higher inEUR/USDsince late last year. The SNB has been intervening to support the CHF recently. With inflation pressure globally and in Switzerland now easing, the SNB could become more tolerant of allowing the CHF to weaken somewhat.” ",1
"Widening policy rate differential withECBsuggests CHF weakness ahead, according to economists at CIBC Capital Markets. SNB to be less activist than ECB “Although we expect additionalSNBpro-activity, we expect the bank to be less activist than its ECB counterpart.” “Narrowing growth differentials add to the presumption widening ECB/SNB policy divergence. Policy differential ended 2022 at 100 bps, we would expect that to widen to 150 bps by the end of Q1. Such policy widening points towards EUR/CHF remaining well supported.” “Q1 2023: 0.99 | Q2 2023: 1.00 (EUR/CHF)” ",1
"Economists at TD Securities like EUR upside versus USD, GBP, and CHF in the months ahead. EUR moves a bit too far, too fast “We’re wary of chasingEUR/USDhigher here. Our GMPCA fair value sits just below 1.07, while HFFV rests around 1.09. In turn, we would look to use dips towards the 1.0750 level to position for a break of 1.10 in the months ahead. We’re forecasting a push towards 1.15 in Q2.” “We see EUR/CHF to 1.06 and EUR/GBP through 0.90 in the months ahead.” ",1

"The Bank of England and ECB both raised rates by 50 basis points. For the Bank of England it's rate has now moved to 4.0% from 0.1% low. It is the second 50 basis point hike in a row. It raised by 75 basis points in the meeting prior to the last two. After one hike of 15 basis points to start the tightening process, the Bank of England has had 4 separate 25 basis point hikes, followed by 50 BPs, 50 BPs, 75 BPs, 50 BPs and 50 BPs to get the rate up from 0.1% to 4.0%. The vote this month came in at 7 to 2 with Tenreyro and Dhingra voting for no change.. That was the same at the last meeting. For the ECB, its main rate moved up to 3.0% from 2.5%. ECB has raised by 50 BPs, 75 BPs, 75 BPs, 50 BPs and another 50 BPs in its march up from 0% to 3.0%. The ECB was more delayed in starting their tightening process. For the Bank of England, the statement got rid of the word ""forcefully"" in its guidance and instead stated that ""if there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening of monetary policy would be required"". Is a pause in the cards? Bailey later said that he ""cannot say for sure that any further rate rises will be in smaller steps"", and ""I am not saying were done with rate rises"". So there is a little hedge in his post comments. Nevertheless the GBP is ending the day as the weakest of the major currencies with a decline of -1.16% versus the US dollar and -1.35% versus the JPY being the biggest movers. As far as the ECB and Lagarde, she did her best to be hawkish, by pre-announcing another 50 bps hike when the central bank meets again in March, but she did say that they would evaluate the subsequent path of monetary policy after that. Lagarde said that there was large consensus (presumably on the rate path for this meeting and next), but there was some opposition to the discussion on communication (I guess the preannounced March increase). The EURUSD moved mostly lower on the day with declines of -0.73% vs the USD and -0.90% vs the JPY, but it did rise vs the GBP by 0.50% and was also up marginally up vs the AUD (+0.12). Looking at the strongest weakest of the major currencies, the JPY is the strongest while the GBP is the weakest. A snapshot of other markets near the close shows: In the US stock market, the NASDAQ index continued its surge to the upside with a gain of 3.25%. That comes after gains of 1.67% on Tuesday and 2.0% on Wednesday. The S&P index added 1.47% today after a 1.0% gain yesterday. The Dow Industrial Average had a modest decline of -0.11%. Yesterday it squeaked out a modest gain of 0.02%. There has been a reallocation out of the industrials, into more of the riskier tech stocks of late. That is the good news. The not so good news is earnings after the close were a bit disappointing with Apple, Amazon and Alphaphet (GOOGL) all missing. Indications point toward a lower opening at least right now for tomorrow's market ahead of the US jobs report. Tomorrow at 8:30 AM ET, the US will announce their jobs report for the month of January. The expectations show: Another day to buckle up.",1
"The JPY is the weakest of the major currencies now, helped by a decline in the USDJPY which yesterday stalled at the high from January 11. Today, the price has been stepping lower. In the US morning session, a further move to the downside, has seen the price move below a swing area between 131.297 and 131.567 and down to a low  of 131.11. That was near the swing high from January 24 which was tested on Friday (on the run higher after the US jobs report). Yesterday, the price gapped above that level to start the week. Today, the gap was filled. The high from January 24 was tested. The USDJPY price is bouncing. What next? The price is back into the swing area between 131.297 and 131.567. With Powell ahead, that area will be the wide barometer for the pair.  Move above 131.567 is a tilt more in the bulls direction.  Move below and then below the 38.2% and we could see more momentum toward the 50% and the rising 100 hour MA at 130.48 area. .",0
"The Swiss Franc is in the doghouse, underperforming the Euro. Economists at HSBC expect this trend to continue over the coming month. USD/CHF to move sideways over the coming month “We look for modest CHF weakness against the EUR in the month ahead, given the rate market is prepared for additional tightening with 40 bps already priced in for the 23 March Swiss National Bank (SNB) meeting. “We do not expect the CHF’s safe haven allure to be especially in demand for the next few weeks, as concerns over a possible Eurozone recession are on the retreat.” “One upside risk to the CHF remains any shift inrisk aversionowing to, for example, a potential escalation in the conflict in Ukraine.” “We expect USD/CHF to move sideways over the coming month.” ",0
"In January the Swiss Franc weakened versus the Euro from 0.9880 to 0.9968. Economists at ING expect the EUR/CHF pair to remain supported. Case for nominal CHF appreciation softens “The case for further nominal CHF appreciation appears to be weakening. Foreign inflation is falling, meaning less nominal CHF appreciation is required to keep the real CHF stable. And CPI in Switzerland is dipping back under 3%.” “Yet January Swiss CPI could spike higher again and we suspect theSNBwill hike another 50 bps again in March (to match some of the ECB tightening).” “Rate differentials moving in favour of the Euro and the risk rally should help EUR/CHF – but the view is mixed.” ",1
"The Swiss National Bank is no doubt one of the central banks that surprised rather on the hawkish side over the past year. Esther Reichelt, FX Analyst at Commerzbank, expects theSNBto remain committed in its fight against inflation, capping EUR/CHF upside. The Swiss Franc is standing up well. “Despite a generally cautious rise in inflation to ‘only’ 3.5% the SNB hiked interest rates decisively and signalled further rates hikes. A further rate hike in March seems certain. The Franc was able to benefit from this determination over the past days.” “In view of the upside risks for US interest rates the market seems to be speculating on the SNB not wanting to fall behind a monetary policy remaining tighter for longer on a global basis.” “SNB is likely to remain alarmed for now, which makes the upper end in EUR/CHF less attractive due to the risk of FX market interventions.”",0
The GBPUSD is moving back toward the falling 100 hour MA at 1.20919. The pair in the late London morning/early US session skimmed against the MA level but could not gather any upside momentum. It would take a move above that level - and stay above - to increase the bullish bias in the short term.  Absent that and the downside is still the bias direction and sellers remain in control.,0
"Swissinflationsurprises on the upside – Franc benefits. Economists at Commerzbank note that for the EUR/CHF pair, the lower end remains attractive for the time being. SNB tolerance for CHF weakness will become increasingly smaller the higher inflation rises “The Franc is currently benefitting from the fact that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is assumed to retain considerable firepower at this stage. Rate expectations have risen over the past few days and the CHF has been able to benefit from the development.” “The risk of possibleSNBinterventions to strengthen the Franc also plays an important part. The SNB communicated that it would continue to sell foreign currency in the future if this was necessary from amonetary policypoint of view, i.e. if a weak CHF is putting upside pressure on inflation. Today’s producer and import prices are likely to illustrate that this is not currently the case.” “Any FX trader is nonetheless likely to be aware that SNB tolerance for CHF weakness will become increasingly smaller the higher inflation rises. For EUR/CHF that means that for now, the lower end remains attractive.” ",1
"The USDJPY has moved higher in trading today as traders worry less about the expected new BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's likely policy tilt. The view is he will maintain the ultra loose policy of his predecessor Kuroda. Looking at the 4 hour chart above, the price has extended up toward the swing area between 132.708 and 132.902. The 50% midpoint of the move down from the December 2022 high is also just below that level at 132.689.  The high price has reached 132.83 so far.  The current price is at 132.71. Sellers are trying to keep a lid on the pair. Risk can of course be defined and limited against the area. That is a benefit to outright sellers and profit takers who want to lighten up after a nice run to start the trading week. The range today is 156 pips. The average over the last month is not much more at 169 pips.  There are reasons to sell. Having said that, a move above would increase the bullish bias more and have traders looking for more upside momentum (stay above is key). Drilling to the 5 minute chart, the pair has been trending higher, and apart from a tiny dip below the rising 100 bar MA (blue line in the chart below), that moving average has led the way higher.

The price has rotated modestly to the downside and trades at 0.6966 currently. In the new trading day a move above the 200 hour MA is needed to kickstart the next run higher.

On the downside, drilling to the 5 minute chart, shows the pair climbing with the 100 hour MA as the guide. After moving lower in the Asian session, the price started to trade back above the 100 and 200 bar MA. After a final test of both near 0.6914, the price stepped higher. A move above the 100 hour MA stalled, and there was another test of the 100 bar MA before an acceleration to the upside near 0.6928.Now with resistance targets starting to be reached, there is some rotation to the downside.

Both of those come near 0.6942 with the 100 bar MA on the 5 minute chart moving to the upside. It would take a move below these levels now to give sellers against the upside targets more confidence.

"“High inflation is damaging and corrosive,” said Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)Governor Philip Lowein his Testimony to the House Economics Committee during early Friday in Asia. “We are not done yet on rates,” said RBA’s Lowe during the question-answer session, following the release of the prepared statement. Additional comments Will do what is necessary to make sure that inflation returns to the target range. It would be dangerous, indeed, not to contain and reverse this period of high inflation. Based on the currently available information, the board expects that further increases will be needed over the months ahead. How much further interest rates need to increase will depend on developments in the global economy, how household spending evolves and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. Path here is a narrow one. It is important that people expect that the high inflation is only temporary. One is the risk of not doing enough, which would result in high inflation persisting and then later proving very costly to get down. The other is the risk that we move too fast, or too far. Inflation expectations remain well anchored and aggregate wage outcomes are not inconsistent with inflation returning to target. It is still possible for us here in Australia to navigate this path. But it is also possible that we are knocked off that narrow path. Very conscious that the impact of higher rates is being felt very unevenly across the community. AUD/USD stays pressured below 0.6900 AUD/USDpays a little heed to the macro as RBA’s Lowe refrains from any fresh signals from what he already spoke in the first round of the testimony.

"Following this week's disappointments in the labour market data, traders are timing into Australia's top central bankers on Friday who are crossing the wires currently. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)Governor Philip Lowesaid further increases in interest rates would be needed in the months ahead to ensure sky-high inflation returns to the target range. Speaking before lawmakers, he said how much further interestratesneed to increase would depend on developments in the global economy, how household spending evolves and theoutlookfor inflation and the labour market. Key comments We are not done yet on rates. Our assessment is we have to raise rates higher.The labour market is still very tight.Could see additional 50,000-70,000 jobs come through data in next month or so.If we saw another weak jobs report might reconsider if labour market still tight. If we stay on top of inflation, rates could start to fall next year.

"AUD/USD takes offers to refresh intraday bottom around 0.6870 as it prints a three-day losing streak following a failed recovery from the six-week low. In doing so, the Aussie pair takes clues from the hawkish Fed bets while hesitating in praising Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe’s readiness for higherrates. It’s worth noting that the job market fears signaled by RBA Assistant Governor (Economic) Luci Ellis exert additional downside pressure on the Aussie pair. “High inflation is damaging and corrosive,” said Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)Governor Philip Lowein his Testimony to the House Economics Committee early Friday in Asia. The policymaker also stated, “We are not done yet on rates”. Following that, RBA’s Ellis said that the labor market is a little less tight than a few months ago. “Exceptionally huge number of people are awaiting new jobs,” added RBA’s Ellis. On a different page, Federal Reserve (Fed) officials were quite hawkish and backed by the strong US data to propel the US Dollar, as well as weigh on the AUD/USD price.  Among them, St. Louis Federal Reserve's James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester were the latest to bolster the greenback. The Fed hawk Bullard said, “Continued policy rate increases can help lock in a disinflationary trend during 2023, even with ongoing growth and strong labor markets, by keeping inflation expectations low.” Fed’s Mester, on the same line, stated that the Fed will need to go above 5% and stay there for a while. The policymaker also added that she is not ready to say if the Fed needs a bigger rate increase at the next policy meeting but said that she would not want to surprise the markets. US data have recently pushed back the calls for the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policy pivot. That said, the latest FEDWATCH read from Reuters signals that the interest rate futures market shows US rates could peak close to 5.25% by July before dropping to 5.0% by the end of the year. Out of the latest US statistics, Producer Price Index (PPI) for January gained major attention as it jumped the most since June with 0.7% MoM figure. Also positive for the US Dollar was the improvement in the US Initial Jobless Claims for the week ended on February 10, 194K versus 200K expected and 195K prior. Alternatively, a slump in the Housing Starts for January and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey for February seemed to have gained a little attention. Elsewhere, US President Joe Biden fired shots at his Chinese counterpart while conveying the expectations for a talk with the Chinese leader, during an interview with NBCNews. “I think the last thing that Xi wants is to fundamentally rip the relationship with theUnited Statesand with me,"" said US President Biden per Reuters. The same weighs on themarket sentimentand the AUD/USD price. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed negative and the S&P 500 Futures dropped 0.30% intraday by the press time. It should be noted that the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels in 2023 with the latest print of 3.86% while its two-year counterpart also printed mild gains to end the day around 4.64%, making rounds to the highest levels since November 2022. With this,the US Dollar Index(DXY) refreshed a six-week high around 104.23 before retreating to 104.03 by Thursday’s end. Moving on, a lack of major data/events joins the risk-off mood and hawkishFedbets to keep the AUD/USD bears hopeful. Technical analysis A daily closing below the 50-DMA, around 0.6885 by the press time, directsAUD/USDprice towards the 200-DMA key support surrounding the 0.6800 round figure, backed by bearish MACD signals and an absence of oversold RSI (14).

"USD/JPYregains upside momentum near the 1.5-month high, following a retreat from the multi-day top, as the Yen pair renews its intraday high near 134.20 as Tokyo opens for Friday. In doing so, the Yen pair justifies the firmer US Treasury bond yields and the hawkishFedconcerns amid upbeat US data and cautious comments from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Officials. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rises to a fresh high since December 30, 2022, up 3.5 basis points to 3.87% by the press time. On the same line, two-year US Treasury bond yields print mild gains to end Thursday around 4.64%, the highest levels since November 2022, making rounds 4.65% at the latest. Underlying the strong Treasury bond yields could be the upbeat US data and hawkish Federal Reserve talks. Recently, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester teased the recession woes while repeating the previous defense of the highestrates. Before that, St. Louis Federal Reserve's James Bullard said, “Continued policy rate increases can help lock in a disinflationary trend during 2023, even with ongoing growth and strong labor markets, by keeping inflation expectations low.” On the other hand, Japan's Finance Minister (FinMin) Shun’ichi Suzuki tried to sell the idea that the latest Bank of Japan (BoJ) nominations are perfect to defend the central bank’s latest role. The same hints at a prolonged easy money policy and weigh on the Japanese Yen (JPY). “Nomination ofBoJnominees as result of consideration towards structural wage hikes and sustainable, stable achievement of the inflation target,” said Japan’s FinMin Suzuki. It should be noted that the US Producer Price Index (PPI) for January gained major attention from the USD/JPY buyers as it jumped the most since June with 0.7% MoM figure. Also positive for the pair was the improvement in the US Initial Jobless Claims for the week ended on February 10, 194K versus 200K expected and 195K prior. Alternatively, a slump in the Housing Starts for January and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey for February seemed to have gained a little attention. Elsewhere, the fresh US-China tension and Russia’s refrain from stepping back when it comes to attacking Ukraine also weigh on the risk appetite and the USD/JPY prices, due to the US Dollar’s safe-haven demand. That said, US President Joe Biden fired shots at his Chinese counterpart while conveying the expectations for a talk with the Chinese leader, during an interview with NBCNews. “I think the last thing that Xi wants is to fundamentally rip the relationship with theUnited Statesand with me,"" said US President Biden per Reuters. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed negative and the S&P 500 Futures dropped 0.30% intraday by the press time. Looking forward, USD/JPY buyers are likely to keep the reins and may propel the price towards refreshing the multi-day high above 134.00 amid a lack of major data/events on the calendar, other than what’s already mentioned above. Technical analysis A successful daily closing beyond the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), around 133.80 by the press time, directs USD/JPY toward the 100-day EMA resistance surrounding 134.75-80.

"The USD/JPY pair regains positive traction following the previous day's modest downtick and rallies back closer to the YTD peak during the Asian session on Friday. The pair currently trades around the 134.70-134.75 region and seems poised to prolong its uptrend witnessed since the beginning of this month. The US Dollar buying remains unabated on the last day of the week amid firming expectations that theFedwill stick to its hawkish stance, which, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. In fact, the USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, hits a fresh six-week low as investors now seem convinced that interestratesare going to remain elevated for longer. The bets were lifted by the incoming positive US macro data, which point to a resilient economy despite rising borrowing costs and stubbornly high inflation. Adding to this, hawkish remarks by a slew of FOMC members suggest that the US central bank will continue to tighten itsmonetary policy. This, in turn, pushes the US Treasury bond yields higher across the board and underpins the Greenback. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond climbs to the highest level since late December. This results in the widening of the US-Japan rate differential, which is seen driving flows away from the Japanese Yen (JPY) and providing an additional boost to the USD/JPY pair. That said, a combination of factors could limit losses for the JPY and cap the upside for the major. Worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs continue to weigh on investors' sentiment, which is evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets. Adding to this, speculations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) governor candidate Kazuo Ueda will dismantle the yield curve control easing mechanism could lend some support to the safe-haven JPY. Nevertheless, theUSD/JPY pairremains on track to post strong weekly gains. From a technical perspective, this week's sustained move beyond the 132.90-133.00 region could be seen as a fresh trigger for bullish traders and add credence to the positiveoutlook. Hence, some follow-through strength, towards reclaiming the 135.00 psychological mark, looks like a distinct possibility. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1
"TheAUD/USDpair extends this week's retracement slide from the 0.7030 area and continues losing ground for the third successive day on Friday. The downward trajectory drags spot prices to the lowest level since January 6 during the Asian session and is sponsored by broad-based US Dollar strength. In fact, the USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, hits a fresh six-week high amid firming expectations for further policy tightening by the Fed. Investors seem convinced that the US central bank will stick to its hawkish stance in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. Moreover, the incoming upbeat US macro data points to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs. This, along with the recent hawkish remarks by several FOMC members, suggests that theFedwill continue to hike interestrates. The markets are now pricing in at least a 25 bps lift-off at each of the next two FOMC policy meetings in March and May. This, in turn, pushes the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note to its highest level since late December and is seen underpinning the buck. Meanwhile, worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising interest rates weigh on investors' sentiment. This is evident from a weaker tone around the equity markets, which further benefits the safe-haven USD and drives flows away from the risk-sensitive Aussie. Apart from the aforementioned fundamental factors, the AUD/USD pair's downfall could also be attributed to some technical selling following the overnight break below the 50-day SMA. This comes on the back of the recent repeated failures to find acceptance above the 0.7000 psychological mark and might have already set the stage for further losses. Moreover, bearish oscillators on the daily chart add credence to the near-term negativeoutlook. This, in turn, suggests that the path of least resistance for the AUD/USD pair is to the downside. In the absence of any relevant market-moving economic data, any attempted bounce will now be seen as a selling opportunity and remain capped near the 50-day SMA support breakpoint.

"GBP/USD bounces off a 1.5-month low to 1.1950 as UK Retail Sales for January offered a positive surprise. Adding strength to the rebound could be the Brexit optimism. However, broad US Dollar strength weighs onthe Cablepair. UK Retail Sales grew 0.5% MoM versus -0.3% marketforecastand -1.0% previous readings. That said, the YoY figures came in as -5.1% compared to -5.5% consensus and -5.8% prior. Also read:UK Retail Sales jump 0.5% MoM in January vs. -0.3% expected Late on Thursday, BBCNewscame out with the headlines suggesting an imminent deal between the UK and the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol. “Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has arrived in Northern Ireland to hold talks with Stormont party leaders,” said BBC News. It’s worth noting that the latest improvement in UK Retail Sales remains insufficient to overcome the dovishBank of England(BoE) bias that takes clues from the downbeat British employment and inflation data, published earlier in the week. Additionally, the Northern Ireland trade deal is the gemstone of Brexit and hence the European Union (EU) may not easily give up on it, which in turn raises doubts about the latest optimism triggered through the BBC news. Furthermore, a slew of clues for the US inflation, employment and output conditions push back the Fed’s policy pivot talks and help the Federal Reserve (Fed) officials to suggest higherrates. The same could be witnessed in the latest read of the FEDWATCH tool, observed via Reuters, which suggests more market bets on the higher Fed rate than earlier signaled by the US central bank in December. That said, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and St. Louis Federal Reserve's James Bullard were the latest to sound the hawkish alarm. It should be observed that the fears surrounding China also weigh on the sentiment, in addition to the highFedrate concerns, which in turn allow the US Dollar to cheer its haven status and drown the GBP/USD pair. Against this backdrop, S&P 500 Futures dropped half a percent intraday to 4,086 while poking the weekly low after falling the most in a month on Thursday. Additionally, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rise to a fresh high since December 30, 2022, whereas the two-year US Treasury bond also renews its highest levels since November 2022. Having witnessed the initial reaction to the UK data, GBP/USD is likely to remain pressured amid a lack of major data/events and comparatively stronger market belief over the Fed’s next moves, versus the pessimism surrounding the BoE. Technical analysis A sustained downside break of a 1.5-month-old ascending trend line joins bearish MACD signals to keep GBP/USD bears hopeful of breaking an upward-sloping support line from November 17, 2022, around 1.1920 by the press time, becomes an important support to watch.

"In the opinion of UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang,GBP/USDcould extend the decline to the 1.1900 region in the next weeks. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that ‘as long as 1.2100 is not breached, GBP could continue to decline’. However, we were of the view that ‘a break of the major support at 1.1960 is unlikely today’. Our view turned out to be correct as GBP rose to 1.2075 in early London trade before dropping to a low of 1.1966. Downward has improved a tad and GBP is likely to break below 1.1960 today. As downward momentum is not strong for now, any decline is unlikely to threaten 1.1900. Overall, only a breach of 1.2045 (minor resistance is at 1.2010) would indicate that the downward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (16 Feb, spot at 1.2040), we highlighted that ‘the risk for GBP has shifted to the downside’ but we held the view that ‘any decline is expected to face solid support at 1.1960’. GBP subsequently dropped to a low of 1.1966 in NY trade before settling at 1.1987 (-0.42%). Downward momentum has improved, albeit not much. In view of the increased downward momentum, a break of 1.1960 would not be surprising. The next support is at 1.1900. On the upside, a breach of 1.2100 (‘strong resistance’ level was at 1.2150 yesterday) would indicate that the downside risk has faded.”",0

However, we stress that a break below here would complete a bearish ‘double top’ to signal a much deeper sell-off, and likely a stronger USD rally more broadly, with support seen next at 1.1646.” “Post this rangebound phase, we are still biased towards an eventual break above 1.2447/49 to target the May high and 61.8% retracement of the 2021/2022 fall at 1.2668/1.2758.”",1

Downward momentum has increased and AUD is likely to weaken further. However, the likelihood of a sustained decline below the major support at 0.6820 is low. Resistance is at 0.6895 but only a break of 0.6920 would indicate that AUD is not weakening further.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (16 Feb, spot at 0.6910), we highlighted that ‘downward momentum is building but AUD has to break below 0.6865 before a sustained decline is likely’. In NY trade, AUD fell below 0.6865 to 0.6841. Downward momentum has improved further and AUD is likely to weaken to 0.6820. Looking ahead, the next support below 0.6820 is at 0.6750.

Our view was not wrong as USD rose to 134.49 in NY trade. While upward momentum has not improved much, the bias for USD remains on the upside. That said, barring a surge in momentum, any advance is unlikely to break the major resistance at 135.00 today.

"The bearish sentiment remains well and sound around the European currency and motivatesEUR/USDto slip back to the 1.0630 region for the first time since early January. EUR/USD remains weak on USD recovery EUR/USD loses ground for the third session in a row at the end of the week amidst the so far unabated recovery in the greenback, which motivates the USD Index (DXY) to extend the recent breakout of the 104.00 barrier. The pair saw its losses accelerate in past hours in response to the persistent hawkish narrative fromFedspeakers – this time Mester and Bullard – while the firmer-than-expected results from the US docket also added to the renewed strength in the buck. Data wise in the Euroland, Producer Prices in Germany contracted at a monthly 1.0% in January and rose 17.8% over the last twelve months. In addition, France’s final figures saw the CPI rise 0.4% MoM in January and 6.0% vs. the same month of 2022. Later in the session, EMU’s Current Account results are also due. In the US, the CB Leading Index will be the sole release seconded by the speech by Richmond Fed T.Barkin. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD appears well on the offered side and probes the area of multi-week lows near 1.0630 at the end of the week. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB. Eminent issues on the back boiler: Continuation of the ECB hiking cycle amidst dwindling bets for a recession in the region and still elevated inflation. Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the growth prospects and inflationoutlookin the region. Risks of inflation becoming entrenched. EUR/USD levels to watch So far, the pair is retreating 0.29% at 1.0640 and a drop below 1.0629 (monthly low February 17) would target 1.0481 (2023 low January 6) en route to 1.0326 (200-day SMA).

"The GBP/USD pair remains under heavy selling pressure for the third straight day on Friday and drops to its lowest level since January 6 during the first half of the European session. The pair currently trades around the 1.1930-1.1925 region, just below the very important 200-day SMA, and seems vulnerable to decline further. The British Pound continues to be weighed down by expectations that the Bank of England's (BoE) current policy-tightening cycle might be nearing the end. The speculations were fueled by softer-than-expected UK consumer inflation figures released on Tuesday, which seem to have eased pressure on the UK central bank to deliver aggressive rate hikes going forward. This, along with strong follow-through US Dollar buying, is seen dragging the GBP/USD pair lower on the last day of the week. Growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance in the wake of stubbornly high inflation lifts the USD to a fresh six-week high. In fact, the markets are now pricing in at least a 25 bps lift-off at each of the next two FOMC policy meetings in March and May. This, in turn, pushes the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond to the highest level since late December. Apart from this, the prevalent risk-off mood further underpins the safe-haven buck. The GBP/USD pair, meanwhile, fails to benefit from the better-than-expected UK Retail Sales figures for January. This, along with a sustained break below the 1.2000 psychological mark and a technically significant 200-day SMA, suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the downside. Hence, some follow-through weakness back towards retesting the YTD low, around the 1.1840 area set in January, looks like a distinct possibility in the absence of any relevant US macro data.

"The USD/JPY pair gains strong positive traction on the last day of the week and climbs to a nearly two-month high heading into the North American session. The pair is currently placed around the 135.00 psychological mark and seems poised to build on the recent appreciating move witnessed over the past two weeks or so. The Japanese Yen (JPY) weakens across the board amid the uncertainty over the path ofmonetary policyunder new Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda. The US Dollar, on the other hand, hits a fresh six-week high amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. This turns out to be a key factor pushing the USD/JPY pair higher. From a technical perspective, this week's sustained break through the 50-day SMA and a subsequent move beyond the 132.90-133.00 supply zone was seen as a key trigger for bullish traders. The latter marks the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent sharp pullback from over a three-decade higher touched in October and should now act as a strong near-term base for the USD/JPY pair. In the meantime, any meaningful slide below the 134.80-134.75 immediate support is likely to attract fresh buyers near the 134.40 region. This, in turn, should help limit the downside for the USD/JPY pair near the 134.00 round-figure mark. That said, a convincing break below might prompt some technical selling and pave the way for a slide back towards the 133.00 strong resistance breakpoint. On the flip side, theUSD/JPY pairseems poised to climb towards the 135.55-135.60 horizontal zone and eventually aim to reclaim the 136.00 mark. The momentum could get extended further towards the 136.75-136.85 confluence resistance, comprising the 38.2% Fibo. level and a technically significant 200-day SMA.

The US Dollar climbs to a fresh six-week high amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interestratesand turns out to be a key factor weighing on the AUD/USD pair. Apart from this, the prevalent risk-off environment further benefits the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and contributes to driving flows away from the risk-sensitive Aussie. From a technical perspective, the overnight breakdown below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) for the first time since November 2022 was seen as a fresh trigger for bears. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart have just started drifting into negative territory and support prospects for an extension of the recent sharp pullback from the highest level since June 2022. Spot prices seem poised to weaken further below the 0.6800 round-figure mark and accelerate the fall towards the next relevant support near the 0.6740-0.6735 region. This is followed by the 100-day SMA, currently around the 0.6715-0.6710 zone, which if broken decisively should set the stage for a further near-term depreciating move for the AUD/USD pair. On the flip side, the 50-day SMA support breakpoint, currently pegged just ahead of the 0.6900 mark, now seems to act as an immediate strong hurdle. Some follow-through buying could lift the AUD/USD pair towards the 0.6945-0.6950 horizontal resistance, above which a fresh bout of a short-covering move should allow bulls to aim to conquer the 0.7000 psychological mark.

"The GBP/USD is staging a recovery after diving to fresh February lows around 1.1914 in the mid-North American session, bolstered by overall US Dollar (USD) weakness. Nevertheless, it remains trading below the important 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2132, keeping the downtrend intact. At the time of writing, the GBP/USD is exchanging hands above the 1.2020 figure, above its opening price by 0.30%. GBP/USD pressured by an expected Fed aggressive path, compared to the BoE Data from both sides of the Atlantic kept the GBP/USD pressured, which finally dropped below the 200-day EMA. A UK inflation report on Tuesday contributed to speculations that theBank of England(BoE) would not hike rates as aggressively as expected. That, alongside softer than expectedConsumer Price Index(CPI) for January in the US, which exceeded estimates by bank analysts, incremented the likelihood of further tightening by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). The last piece of the puzzle that propelled US Treasury bond yields and the US Dollar (USD) was the Producer Price Index (PPI) for January, with data coming higher than estimates on a monthly basis. That spurred hawkish commentary by two Federal Reserve (Fed) officials, who said thatratesneed to be higher for longer, foreseeing them above the 5.0% threshold. Another factor that influenced investors’ reaction was the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, which collapsed, but comments in the poll by business executives commented that input prices jumped for the first time in 10 months. Given the backdrop, money market futures are pricing in a more hawkish Federal Reserve. Therefore, the GBP/USD extended its losses on Thursday, dropping 0.26%. But as the New York session progresses, the Pound Sterling (GBP) has gained traction against the US Dollar (USD), setting the stage to challenge the 100-day EMA. GBP/USD Technical analysis The GBP/USD pair daily chart portrays the pair as downward biased, even though it’s recovering from falling for two straight days. The major found buyers around the 1.1900 area, which triggered an uptick to the day’s high at 1.2037, the 100-day EMA, where the GBP/USD was quickly rejected. If the GBP/USD achieves a daily close above the 100-day EMA, the pair will rally toward the confluence of the 200 and 20-day EMAs, each at 1.2132/35, respectively. On the other hand, a bearish resumption could happen once the GBP/USD tumbles below 1.1914, followed by the 1.1900 figure.  GBP/USD  ",1

At the time of writing, the AUD/USD exchanges hands at 0.6877 Globalstocksfinished on a lower note as investors increased their bets that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will tighten policy above earlier expectations. Last week’s January inflation reports in the United States (US), namely theConsumer Price Index(CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI), were lower compared to December’s data but above estimates. In fact, the highlight of the week was PPI on a monthly basis, exceeding the consensus and the prior month’s figure, which justifiedFedofficials’ hawkish commentary during the week. On Thursday, Cleveland and St. Louis Fed Presidents Loretta Mester and James Bullard commented that they’re seeing compelling evidence to raise rates by 50 bps in upcoming meetings. Today, Fed Governor Michell Bowman stated that the US central bank has not finished tightening monetary conditions and reiterated that “we haven’t beaten inflation.” Meanwhile, Richmond’s Fed President Thomas Barkin said that getting inflation back to the Fed’s 2% goal “will require more rate increases,” said reporters following an event in Rosslyn, Virginia. “How many of those I think we’ll have to see ... what you see is progress, but slow progress, you don’t see victory.” Elsewhere, in the Asian session, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philipe Lowe said that based on incoming data, theRBAboard estimates that additional rate increases will be needed “over the months ahead to ensure that inflation returns to target and that this period of high inflation is only temporary.” “If we don’t get on top of inflation and bring it down in a timely way, the end result will be even higher interestratesand more unemployment in the future,” Lowe said. Given the backdrop and worse than estimates Australian labor market date revealed on Wednesday, the US Dollar (USD) regained composure and weighed on the Australian dollar.

The upside bias for the Aussie asset is still favored as the risk profile is still solid. The major is expected to continue its upside to near the round-level resistance of 0.6900 despite renewed concerns about a rebound in the United States inflation. S&P500 futures witnessed some losses on Friday and ended the week with mild losses as fresh concerns about a rebound in the USConsumer Price Index(CPI) raised red flags for economic recovery. The odds are favoring the continuation of policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) as the battle against stubborn inflation is getting complicated. The trading activity is expected to remain light as the US markets are closed on Monday because of President’s Day. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Sunday that China would cross a “red line” if the country decided to provide lethal military aid to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

"GBP/USD retreats towards the 1.2000 psychological magnet, down 0.13% intraday on early Monday, as fresh Brexit fears join the mixed fundamentals surrounding the UK and theBank of England(BoE). Even so, the Cable pair traders remain inactive amid the US holiday and cautious mood ahead of the key activity data. Recently, the Telegraph came out with thenewssuggesting a fresh Brexit blow as it said, “UK PM Rishi Sunak forced to ‘pause’ protocol deal amid backlash from senior Tories and DUP.” It should be noted that the British media previously raised expectations of the much-awaited Brexit deal in Northern Ireland. On the same line, EU Commissioner for Interinstitutional Relations and Foresight Maroš Šefčovič said on Friday that they made good progress in Brexit talks with British Foreign Secretary James cleverly, as reported by Reuters. Elsewhere, the UK reported a mixed bag of data, mostly downbeat, and raised doubts on the BoE’s ability to further propel therates, as well as help the economy avoid recession.  That said, the UKConsumer Price Index(CPI) for January marked the third monthly decline after rising to the 41-year high in October whereas the UK Retail Sales came in firmer for the said month. However, the latest British job numbers appear mixed. On the other hand, the firmer prints of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales followed the previously flashed upbeat readings of employment and output data and propelled the odds of the US economy witnessing more inflation ahead. The same joins hawkish Federal Reserve comments to underpin the firmer US Treasury bond yields and the US Dollar to exert downside pressure on the GBP/USD price. It’s worth noting that the UK’s grim labor conditions also weigh onthe Cableprice as most of the Union workers aren’t ready to accept the government’s offer and keep stopping the output. Against this backdrop, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels since early November while the equity benchmarks were mostly in the red. That said,the US Dollar Index(DXY) marked the third consecutive weekly gain. Looking forward, the first readings of the UK’s February month PMIs will join the monetary policy meeting minutes by the Federal Reserve (Fed), up for publishing on Wednesday, as well as the Thursday’s second reading of the US fourth quarter (Q4) Gross Domestic Product, to direct immediate GBP/USD moves.

In doing so, the Aussie pair retreats from the 50-DMA amid bearish MACD signals. While the quote’s failure to cross the short-term DMA join downbeat oscillators, a convergence of the 200-DMA and an upward-sloping support line appears a tough nut to crack for the AUD/USD bears around 0.6800. Following that, a slump toward the previous monthly low surrounding 0.6685 seems imminent. In a case where the AUD/USD price remains bearish past 0.6685, lows marked during the last December and late November, respectively near 0.6630 and 0.6585, will gain major attention. Alternatively, the Aussie pair’s recovery beyond the 50-DMA hurdle surrounding 0.6890 isn’t an open invitation to the bulls as the 0.6900 round figure and a downward-sloping resistance line from February 02, close to 0.6965 at the latest could challenge the upside momentum. Even if the AUD/USD price remains firmer past 0.6965, the previous weekly high of around 0.7030, will act as the last defense of the bears.

That said, geopolitical concerns about China, North Korea and Russia have recently weighed on themarket sentiment, even if the light calendar and absence of US/Canadian traders restrict the momentum. During the weekend, North Korea fired two ballistic missiles toward Japan and renewed the fears that the hermit kingdom is up to something serious that can endanger the global economy, mainly due to the nature of the missiles fired as they both were termed as tactical nuclear attack weapons. On the same line, the latest meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's top diplomat Wang Yi seemed to have failed in restoring the US-China ties. The reason could be linked to a Chinese diplomat’s comments saying that the US must change course and repair the damage done to Sino-US ties by indiscriminate use of force. On the same line, US ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Sunday that China would cross a “red line” if the country decided to provide lethal military aid to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Elsewhere, better-than-forecast prints of the USConsumer Price Index(CPI) and Retail Sales followed the previously flashed upbeat readings of employment and output data and propelled the US Treasury bond yields, as well as the US Dollar. On the same line could be the hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) comments and the risk-negative catalysts mentioned above. That said, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman recently said, “We are seeing a lot of inconsistent data in economic conditions,” as reported by Reuters. On the contrary, RichmondFedPresident Thomas Barkin said that they are seeing some progress on inflation with demand normalizing, as reported by Reuters. It should be noted that the mixed bias for the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) new monetary policy board and chatters of higher inflation in Japan seem to put a floor under the Yen. Amid these plays, the S&P 500 Futures print mild losses even as Wall Street closed mixed. It’s worth noting that the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels since early November in the last week and helped the DXY to print a three-week uptrend.

The pullback also takes clues from the RSI’s (14) hesitance in rising further to favor sellers. With this, the EUR/USD bears are all set to revisit the 1.0630-15 support area comprising multiple levels marked since early January 2023. Following that, the 1.0600 and 1.0500 may entertain the EUR/USD sellers before directing them to the previous monthly low surrounding 1.0480.

Meanwhile, recovery moves may initially aim for the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level surrounding 1.0700, also known as the golden Fibonacci retracement. However, major attention will be given to a convergence of the 50-SMA and a downward-sloping resistance line from February 01, close to 1.0705-10.

Meanwhile, the GBP/USD pair’s run-up beyond the immediate resistance line, previous support near 1.2055, isn’t the confirmation of further advances as a 3.5-month-old previous support line, close to 1.2300, could challenge the buyers afterward.

The Aussie asset has been strengthened as investors have shrugged-off uncertainty associated with US-China tensions and the launch of three projectiles from North Korea near Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The US Dollar Index(DXY) has surrendered its entire gains added in the Asian session and is looking to continue its downside journey ahead. Meanwhile, the risk appetite theme has regained traction, which is supporting the risk-perceived assets. S&P500 futures have turned volatile ahead of the market holiday on account of Presidents’ Day. People’s Bank of China maintains the status quo on interest rates The Australian Dollar remained in action after the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) kept its monetary policy unchanged. An interest rate decision of unchanged policy was widely anticipated as the Chinese economy is focusing on accelerating the economic recovery after remaining bound by pandemic controls. The People’s Bank of China has kept one-year and five-year Loan PrimeRates(LPR) unchanged at 3.65% and 4.30% respectively. It is worth noting that Australia is a leading trading partner of China and the continuation of expansionary monetary policy by the People’s Bank of China will strengthen the Australian Dollar ahead. Fresh concerns for higher US Inflation call for more rates by the Fed Last week, a majority of economicindicatorscleared that it would be early for the Federal Reserve to announce a win in the battle against stubborn inflation as it is set to surprise the market ahead. The United StatesConsumer Price Index(CPI) landed higher at 6.4% than the projections of 6.2%, Producer Price Index (PPI) released at 6.0% higher than the consensus of 5.4%. And, the release of the monthly Retail Sales data at 3.0% against the consensus of 1.8% was the last nail in the coffin, which cleared that consumer spending is gaining traction. A note from Goldman Sachs states the investment banking firm expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates three more times this year, lifting their estimates after data pointed to persistent inflation and a resilient labor market, as reported by Reuters. Spotlight shifts to Reserve Bank of Australia and Federal Reserve’s minutes This week, the release of the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia and Federal Reserve’s and Federal Reserve will lead from the front for the power-pack action in the Aussie asset. Federal Reserve policymakers are aware of the persistent nature of the US inflation, which is why hawkish guidance is expected on interest rates. The minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia policy announced in the first week of February resulted in a ninth consecutive interest rate hike to 3.35%. Inflationary pressures in the Australian economy have not softened yet amid solid consumer spending, which is bolstering the case of hawkish guidance on the monetary policy. Later this week, Australia’s Labor Cost Index (Q4) data will remain in focus. The economic data is seen at 3.4% vs. the prior release of 3.1% on an annual basis. And, the quarterly data is seen lower at 0.7% against the prior release of 1.0%. AUD/USD technical outlook  AUD/USD has negated the downside break of the Head and Shoulder chart pattern formed on a four-hour scale. The responsive buying active from the market participants has pushed the Aussie asset above the neckline of the aforementioned chart pattern plotted from January 10 low at 0.6860. The asset has scaled above the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6888, which indicates that the short-term trend is bullish now. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has rebounded into the 40.00-60.00 range, which indicates that the asset is no more bearish now. AUD/USD    ",0
"According to Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group, the prospects for a sustained drop below 1.0615 inEUR/USDappear diminished for the time being. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected EUR to weaken last Friday but we were of the view that it ‘is unlikely to challenge the major support at 1.0615’. While EUR cracked 1.0615 (low of 1.0611) in London trade, it rebounded strongly to end the day higher by 0.24% (1.0694). The rebound amid oversold conditions suggests EUR is unlikely to weaken further. Today, EUR is more likely to consolidate within a range of 1.0650/1.0720.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our most recent narrative was from last Thursday (16 Feb, spot at 1.0690) where ‘downward momentum is building again but EUR has to break and stay below 1.0655 before a sustained decline is likely’. We indicated, ‘a clear break of 1.0655 will shift the focus to 1.0615, followed by 1.0535’. While EUR subsequently took out both 1.0655 and 1.0615, it rebounded strongly from 1.0611 to end the day higher by 0.24% (1.0694). Downward momentum has waned somewhat with the strong rebound and the likelihood of a sustained decline in EUR below 1.0615 is not high. That said, only a breach of 1.0740 (‘strong resistance’ level was at 1.0760 last Friday) would indicate that the current downward pressure.”",1
"The GBP/USD pair has printed a fresh day high at 1.2045 in the early London session.The Cableis looking to extend its gains to 1.2050 as the risk-off impulse has faded away despite no negative development on the US-China tensions and three missiles launched by North Korea near Japan’s region. The US Dollar Index(DXY) has refreshed its day low at 103.52 as investors ignored the fears of persistent inflation and a robust labor market in the United States. S&P500 futures have recovered their entire losses and are looking to shift into a positive trajectory amid the risk appetite theme. No doubt, the declining trend in the US inflation is still intact as the figures have dropped from their prior numbers. However, the releases of theConsumer Price Index(CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) above its estimates have cleared that the battle against inflation is far from over yet. And, the release of the upbeat monthly Retail Sales indicates that consumer spending has recovered vigorously. Going forward, the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes will provide detailed guidance on the interest rate policy ahead. But before that, the release of the US S&P PMI data will be keenly watched. The preliminary Manufacturing PMI (Feb) is seen lower at 46.8 vs. the prior release of 46.9. And the Services PMI is seen at 46.6 against the former release of 46.8. Meanwhile, the Pound Sterling remained in action after the United Kingdom's Telegraph reported that UK Prime Minister (PM) Rishi Sunak has been forced to “pause” his Northern Ireland protocol deal amid a backlash from senior Tories and unionists. Going forward, Tuesday’s S&P PMI (Feb) data will remain in the spotlight. The preliminary Manufacturing PMI is seen lower at 46.8 while the Services PMI is expected to decline to 48.3. GBP/USD  ",1
"GBP/USDstill risks a deeper pullback as well as 1.2100 caps the upside, note Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted last Friday that GBP ‘is likely to break 1.1960 but it is unlikely to threaten the next support at 1.1900’. Our view turned out to be correct as GBP dropped to 1.1915. However, we did not anticipate the sharp bounce from the low as GBP closed higher by 0.46% (1.2043). The sharp and rapid rebound in GBP has room to extend but any advance is viewed as part of a higher trading range of 1.1990/1.2075. In other words, a sustained rise above 1.2075 is unlikely.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Last Friday (17 Feb, spot at 1.1985), we highlighted that ‘downward momentum has improved, albeit not much’. We added, ‘GBP is likely to break 1.1960 and the next support is at 1.1900’. GBP subsequently dropped close to 1.1900 (low of 1.1915) before rebounding strongly. With the strong rebound, downward momentum has waned, but as long as the ‘strong resistance’ at 1.2100 (level is unchanged from last Friday) is not breached within the next few days, there is still a slim chance for GBP to break below 1.1900.”",0
"The USD/JPY pair struggles to gain any traction on Monday and seesaws between tepid gains/minor losses through the early European session. The pair is currently placed just above the 134.00 round figure and for now, seems to have stalled Friday's modest pullback from a nearly two-month high. Against the backdrop of looming recession risks, geopolitical tensions drive some haven flows towards the Japanese Yen (JPY) and acts as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair. After firing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the sea off Japan's west coast over the weekend, North Korea launched two more ballistic missiles off its east coast on Monday. This comes amid talk of Russia ramping up attacks in Ukraine and lending some support to traditional safe-haven assets, including the JPY. The downside for the USD/JPY pair, however, remains cushioned amid the underlying bullish sentiment surrounding the US Dollar, bolstered by the prospects for further policy tightening by theFed. The markets are pricing in at least a 25 bps lift-off at each of the next two FOMC policy meetings in March and May. The bets were reaffirmed last week after the US CPI and PPI data showed that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped, and hawkish comments by several Fed policymakers. This, in turn, is holding back traders from placing aggressive bets around the USD/JPY pair ahead of the FOMCmonetary policymeeting minutes, due for release on Wednesday. Investors also await Friday's testimony from the newly nominated head of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda for his view on the future of yield curve control (YCC) and super-easy monetary policy. This, in turn, will play a key role in influencing theUSD/JPY pairand help determine the next leg of a directional move. In the meantime, relatively lighter trading volumes on the back of the Presidents' Day holiday in the US, could lead to an extension of the USD/JPY pair's range-bound price action on Monday. From a technical perspective, last week's breakout through the 132.90-133.00 resistance zone favours bullish traders, suggesting that any meaningful pullback could be seen as a buying opportunity. After Friday's bearish shooting star candlestick, a bearish day on Monday will confirm a reversal, thus confirming a possible pullback into a 'buy zone'. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1

"In the opinion of Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group, the idea of further downside inAUD/USDseems to be losing momentum in the short term. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Last Friday, we highlighted that AUD ‘is likely to weaken further but the likelihood of a sustained decline below the major support at 0.6820 is low’. While our view was not wrong as AUD dropped to 0.6817, we did quite anticipate the sharp rebound from the low as AUD closed little changed at 0.6879 (-0.01%). Not surprisingly, downward pressure has eased. We view the current movement as part of a consolidation and expect AUD to trade sideways between 0.6850 and 0.6915.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We highlighted last Friday (17 Feb, spot at 0.6865) that ‘downward momentum has improved further and AUD is likely to weaken to 0.6820’. Our view was not wrong as AUD dropped to 0.6817 but we did not expect the rapid rebound from the low. Downward momentum is beginning to wane and the chance for AUD to drop below 0.6820 in a sustained manner has decreased. However, only a breach of 0.6950 (no change in ‘strong resistance’ level from last Friday) would indicate that the risk of a sustained drop below 0.6820 has fizzled out.”",0

"The single currency clings to the recent bullish move and encouragesEUR/USDto return to the 1.0700 neighbourhood at the beginning of the week. EUR/USD looks to USD, data EUR/USD alternates gains with losses amidst the equally vacillating mood in the global markets on Monday and attempts to extend the bounce off February lows near 1.0600 the figure recorded on Friday. So far, it seems cautiousness has started to dominate the markets’ mood ahead of the release of the FOMC Minutes and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge – the PCE – on Wednesday and Friday, respectively. The recent pullback in spot, in the meantime, came against the backdrop of further hawkish remarks from Fed’s policy makers vs. some doubts regarding the rate path that emerged amidst ECB’s rate setters past the March gathering. Absent releases inthe US dataspace, the focus of attention will be on the publication of the advanced Consumer Confidence in the euro bloc tracked by the European Commission (EC). What to look for around EUR EUR/USD regains some traction on Monday, although it appears to have met quite a solid hurdle around the 1.0700 mark. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB. Key events in the euro area this week: EMU Flash Consumer Confidence (Monday) – EMU New Car Registrations, EMU/Germany/France Advanced PMIs, Germany ZEW Economic Sentiment (Tuesday) – Germany Final Inflation Rate/IFO Business Climate, France Business Confidence (Wednesday) – EMU Final Inflation Rate (Thursday) – Germany Final Q4 GDP Growth Rate/GfK Consumer Confidence (Friday).

"TheAUD/USDpair builds on Friday's goodish rebound from the vicinity of the 0.6800 mark, or its lowest level since January 6, and gains strong follow-through traction on the first day of a new week. The pair maintains its bid tone through the early part of the European session and is currently placed around the 0.6900 mark, just a few pips below the daily high. Some optimism over a potential recovery in China, along with supply disruptions in Panama, lend support to Copper prices and benefit the resources-linked Australian Dollar. Apart from this, subdued US Dollar price action turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair. That said, the fundamental backdrop still seems tilted in favour of bearish traders and warrants caution before positioning for any meaningful upside. Against the backdrop of looming recession risks, geopolitical tensions weigh on investors' sentiment and should cap the AUD/USD pair. In fact, North Korea launched two more ballistic missiles off its east coast on Monday after firing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the sea off Japan's west coast over the weekend. Adding to this, talks of Russia ramping up attacks in Ukraine should keep a lid on the risk-sensitive Aussie. Moreover, firming expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will stick to its hawkish stance in the wake of stubbornly high inflation favours the USD bulls. Traders also seem reluctant ahead of the release of the policy meeting minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday and theFedon Wednesday.

Our view for USD to strengthen was correct even though it rose above 135.00 (high of 135.04) before pulling back sharply.

The pair retreats to the lower end of its daily range during the first half of the European session, though manages to hold above the 1.2000 psychological mark. Hopes of an imminent breakthrough in trade negotiations regarding the Northern Ireland Protocol support the Pound Sterling.

However, in the absence of any concrete outcome to the intratable issue the uptick for the major stalls. Meanwhile, a combination of supporting factors assists the US Dollar, which, in turn, acts as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. Against the backdrop of looming recession risks, fresh geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on investors' sentiment and benefit the Greenback's relative safe-haven status. Adding to this, firming expectations that the Fed will stick to its hawkish stance provide a modest lift to the USD. In fact, the markets are now pricing in at least a 25 bps lift-off at each of the next two FOMC policy meetings in March and May. The bets were reaffirmed by the US CPI and PPI data last week, which showed that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. In contrast, the softer-than-expected UK consumer inflation figures fueled speculations that the Bank of England's (BoE) current rate-hiking cycle might be nearing the end. The divergent Fed-BoE policy expectations also contribute to capping the upside for the GBP/USD pair. The downside, however, seems cushioned, at least for the time being, amid relatively thin trading volumes in the wake of the President Day's holiday in the US. Traders also seem reluctant and might refrain from placing aggressive bets ahead of the latest FOMCmonetary policymeeting minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday. Several Fed officials, includingChairman Jerome Powell, recently stressed the need to keep raisingratesgradually to fully gain control of inflation.

"In the opinion of Kit Juckes, Chief Global FX Strategist at Société Générale, the Dollar’s bounce is fading, unless the Fed starts talking tough. EUR/USD is stuck “Presidents’ Day has delivered a slow morning for markets, albeit one with a slight positive bias to Asian and Europeanequities, that helps risk sentiment more broadly and in so doing, has prevented the Dollar from rising any further today.” “In terms ofEUR/USD, there are two reasons why the dollar’s bounce is getting stuck. The first is that 2023 growth forecasts are still converging on the back of European optimism. The second is that the move in relative EU-USratesthat triggered the Dollar’s bounce at the start of this month, has petered out.” “I suspect that further significant Dollar strength will require the Fed Funds futures market to start pricing in a 50 bps rate hike in March. After all, the market currently prices a very high probability of a 50 bps hike by the ECB in March.” ",1

According to Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs raised its bet on Chineseequities, as its reopening would underpin global growth. Therefore, flows to the AUD/USD boosted the Aussie Dollar (AUD), despite the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) resolution to tackle high inflation in the US. Another reason that has underpinned the AUD/USD is that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will raise rates on Wednesday, a headwind for the US Dollar (USD). Even though the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raisedratesduring the last week, a dismal employment report triggered a reversal, which weighed on theAUD/USD. What to watch?

Currently, within the right-hand shoulder's formation, there is an M-pattern on the daily chart that is formed above where there was a break of structure, BoS, at the start of the year. The price has corrected the bearish leg of the pattern to a 38.2% Fibonacci level near 1.2050 and should this hold as resistance, at the neckline of the pattern, then a downside extension would be in order for a run to test 1.1850 territory for the days ahead.

"TheUSD/JPYfluctuated in Monday’s session as US financial markets remained closed during President’s Day. US equity futures are negative, except for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The US Dollar continued to trend lower, while US Treasury bond yields capped the USD/JPY fall. The USD/JPY is trading at 134.23, above its opening price by 0.07%. After reclaiming the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 132.73, the USD/JPY enjoyed a rally that peaked at around 135.11. Bull’s failure to hold gains above the latter exacerbated a fall to the 134.20s area, mainly driven by the fall in the US 10-year benchmark note rate, which finished last Friday’s session on a lower note. Last week’s US inflation data in the consumer segment showed some slowing down. Prices paid by producers, also known as PPI, rose above estimates and the previous month’s reading on a monthly basis. Therefore, traders shifted from a risk-on to a risk-off environment, as traders expect a more hawkish than estimated US Federal Reserve (Fed). In the meantime, changes in the Bank of Japan (BoJ) are increasing volatility in the pair. Given that Kazuo Ueda remains the leader to become the new BoJ Governor, investors are positioning toward a more hawkish BoJ stance. On early Monday in the Asian session, the current BoJ Deputy Governor Amamiya said that theBoJhas the necessary tools to exit from ultra-loose monetary conditions. What to watch?  USD/JPY Technical analysis The USD/JPY uptrend lost steam as it formed an inverted hammer near the peak at around 135.00. Buyers’ failure to hold to the latter exacerbated a retracement below the 100-day EMA at 134.72, opening the door to consolidate within the important 200-day EMA at 133.77 and 134.70, a 100 pip range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shifted falt though at bullish territory, signals that buyers are taking a respite, while the Rate of Change (RoC), is almost unchanged. Break above the 100-day EMA, and the USD/JPY might re-test 135.00. On the downside, a break below 134.00 would challenge the 200-day EMA. ",0
" AUD/USD fades the week-start optimism even as Australian activity data for February came in firmer during early Tuesday. Adding strength to the pullback moves could be the return of the full markets and the geopolitical fears. Furthermore, the cautious mood ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes also weakens the risk-barometer pair. The Aussie pair retreats to 0.6910 at the latest, following the previous day’s run-up to 0.6920. Australia’s preliminary readings of the S&P Global PMIs for February were firmer asManufacturing PMIrose to 50.1, versus 49.9 expected and 50.0 prior, while the Services PMI increased to 49.2 from 48.6 previous readings and 48.4 market forecasts. Further, the S&P Global Composite PMI also improved to 49.2 from 48.5. Even so, the AUD/USD pair failed to cheer the upbeat data and retreated to 0.6910 following the release. The Aussie pair’s latest pullback could be linked to the return of the full markets and the latest challenges to the sentiment, mainly emanating from geopolitical fears surrounding China, Russia and North Korea. On the same line could be the hopes of witnessing dovish remarks of the RBA policymakers from today’s RBA Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes. On Monday, AUD/USD remained firmer amid hopes of more stimulus from China after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) left its monetary policy unchanged. Also seemed to have helped the pair buyers could be the last round of Federal Reserve (Fed) talks that came in slightly offbeat, not to forget the President’s Day holiday in the US. During these plays, Wall Street was closed, and US Treasury yields eased, which weighed onthe US Dollar Index(DXY) and allowed the AUD/USD to remain firmer, extending Friday’s rebound from the six-week low. Moving on, the return of full markets may highlight the geopolitical fears surrounding the US-China tussles over Taiwan and balloon shooting, not to forget the North Korean missile firing, to weigh on the sentiment and the AUD/USD prices. However, major attention will be given to the RBA Minutes and the US S&P Global PMIs for clear directions. Should theRBAfails to defend its hawkish bias, as well as the US PMIs appear firmer, the AUD/USD could reverse the recent gains.

In doing so,the Cablepair seesaws around the 100-Hour Moving Average (HMA) amid the trader’s cautious mood ahead of the first readings of the UK Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMI) for February. Not only the 100-HMA level surrounding 1.2040 but the 200-HMA level surrounding 1.2075 also challenges the GBP/USD pair buyers. Following that, a downward-sloping resistance line from February 02, close to 1.2125 at the latest, will be important to watch as a break of which could convince GBP/USD buyers to challenge the monthly high surrounding the 1.2400 threshold. During the run-up, the previous weekly high near 1.2270 may act as an intermediate halt. Meanwhile, the 1.2000 psychological maget precedes the 1.1960 support to restrict short-term GBP/USD downside. However, the recent low near 1.1920-15 joins an upward-sloping support line from mid-November 2022 to act as a tough nut to crack for the GBP/USD bears to conquer. To sum up, GBP/USD remains tight-lipped ahead of the key UK data. However, the sluggish oscillators and multiple hurdles to the north keep sellers hopeful.

The minutes give a full account of the policy discussion, including differences of view. They also record the votes of the individual members of the Committee.

"GBP/USD renewed its intraday low near 1.2020 early Tuesday morning as traders cheered the return of the Western traders following an extended weekend due to the US holidays. In addition to the full market’s return, the Cable pair traders also portray fears emanating from the Brexit deal negotiations and doubts over the small industries’ optimism. Late on Monday, the UK Times came out with the news suggesting British Ministers are prepared to resign over (Prime Minister) Rishi Sunak’s Brexit deal if it risks Northern Ireland’s place within the UK. “There is a mounting backlash among Eurosceptic Conservative MPs to the deal,” mentioned The Times. Elsewhere, The Times quotes Barclay’s industrial survey to state that bosses of small companies are increasingly upbeat about their prospects. The same adds to evidence that theoutlookfor the British economy may not be as bad as has been feared, mentioned in thenews. Above all, fears of amonetary policydivergence between theFedand theBank of England(BoE), backed by the week’s British mixed statistics and the strong US data, seem to weigh on the GBP/USD price. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields picked up bids to near the highest levels marked since early November 2022, mildly bid around 3.86% at the latest. It should be noted that the geopolitical fears emanating from China and Russia also seem to underpin the US Dollar’s safe-haven demand and weigh on the GBP/USD price. Preliminary readings of the S&P Global PMIs for February will be crucial for the GBP/USD pair traders. That said, upbeat data from the UK becomes necessary to put a floor under the prices as the latest US Treasury bond yields’ moves favored the US Dollar ahead of the key US PMIs.

"USD/JPY grinds higher around intraday top surrounding 134.35-40 amid a three-day uptrend during early Tuesday. In doing so, the Yen pair tracks the recent pick up in the US Treasury bond yields while struggling to justify hawkish comments from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and the mixed Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for February. That said, preliminary readings of Japan’s Jibun BankManufacturing PMIdropped to the lowest levels since September 2020, to 47.4 versus 48.9 expected and prior. The Services PMI, however, offered a positive surprise with a 53.6 figure compared to 51.5 market forecasts and 51.1 previous readouts. Elsewhere, BoJ’s Kuroda said wage growth would likely accelerate as companies increase pay to compensate households for the higher cost of living and cope with an intensifying labor shortage. The same raises fears of a higher BoJ rate when Kuroda retires in April. However, the talks that Kuroda will play his last shot strongly enough to mark his reign at theBoJas a remarkable dovish one keep the USD/JPY buyers hopeful. It should be noted that yields recovered on the full markets’ return as hawkish hopes from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) renewed, which underpinned the US Dollar’s recovery. On the other hand, the US and China alleged each other over the balloon shooting, whereas the US diplomatic ties with Taiwan teased Beijing. On the same line, the United Nations (UN) Security Council is alarmed by Japan for North Korea’s missile testing, and the same weigh on the sentiment and favors the US Dollar.

In doing so, the Aussie pair fails to cheer the hawkish Minutes Statement from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the upbeat Australian activity data. The reason could be linked to the market’s risk-off mood and the US Dollar’s rebound during the week's first trading day. US Dollar Index(DXY) snaps a two-day losing streak while marking mild gains near 104.00. In doing so, the greenback’s gauge versus the six major currencies traces the US Treasury bond yields and benefits from the traditional haven status.

While portraying the mood, S&P 500 Futures declined 0.40% intraday to 4,070 at the latest. Elsewhere, the latestRBAMeeting Minutes signaled that the monetary policy board considered a hike of 25 basis points (bps) or 50bp but did not discuss a pause in the rate hikes. The Minutes Statement also raised doubts about the frequent hawkish moves and weighed on the AUD/USD while mentioning, “Monthly meetings allowed for frequent adjustments,rateshad already risen substantially.” It should be noted that the first readings of Australia’s S&P Global PMIs came in better than forecasts in February. However, onlyManufacturing PMIcrossed the 50.0 benchmark that divides activity contraction from expansion. On a different page, the US and China alleged each other over the balloon shooting. In contrast, the US diplomatic ties with Taiwan teased Beijing on Monday, which weighed on the sentiment and the risk barometer AUD/USD pair. On the same line, the United Nations (UN) Security Council is alarmed by Japan for North Korea’s missile testing and could help the US Dollar to remain firmer due to its safe-haven status. Looking forward, a few more PMIs, especially from the US, will be important for the AUD/USD pair traders, but major attention should be given to the risk catalysts and theFedMinutes for clear directions. Should the US data track the recent pattern of posting positive surprises and/or the FOMC Minutes also portray the hawkish mood, the Aussie pair will have a further downside to track.

"GBP/USD lacks follow-through as it prints mild losses around 1.2020 heading into Tuesday’s London open, flirting with an intraday low by the press time. In doing so,the Cablepair takes clues from the technical candlestick formation, as well as fundamentals surrounding Brexit and the market sentiment. Monday’s bearish Doji teases the GBP/USD sellers amid fears of no imminent Brexit deal as the UK’s Conservative Members of the Parliament (MPs) dislike the deal with the European Union (EU) on Northern Ireland (NI). Some of them are threatening to resign, per The Times, amid fears of the compromised deal. Thenewsalso mentioned that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spent notable time in the House of Commons to convince the MPs that no deal had yet been agreed and talks were continuing. “He was told he ‘hasn’t got a hope’ of succeeding without the support of the Democratic Unionist Party,” per The Times. Elsewhere, a pick-up in the US Treasury bond yields joins the geopolitical fears surrounding North Korea, China and Russia to weigh on themarket sentimentand underpin the US Dollar’s rebound as the US traders return after a long weekend. Also adding strength to the greenback, which in turn weighs on the GBP/USD price, could be the market’s concerns that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be more hawkish than theBank of England(BoE). To confirm the same, Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)Monetary PolicyMeeting Minutes will be eyed closely. Ahead of that, the preliminary readings of the UK and the US Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for February should offer intermediate clues. It’s worth noting that the British numbers have mostly been disappointing of late and hence downbeat UK PMIs are likely to weigh on the Cable pair, especially amid Brexit woes and geopolitical fears. On the other hand, the US figures have been positive in recent days and hence odds of the GBP/USD pair’s further weakness on upbeat data can’t be ruled out.

"The EUR/USD pairhas slipped to near 1.0660 in the Asian session as the risk appetite of the market participants has trimmed ahead of the global PMI figures. Investors are worried that higher interest rates by the majority of central banks in taming the stubborn inflation have impacted the scale of economic activities. Firms have no other option than to tap funding on higher borrowing costs. Therefore, producers are dodging borrowing or limiting them to fulfill the essential requirements. The major currency pair has witnessed a steep fall after surrendering the 1.0670 cushion and is expected to display more weakness ahead asthe US Dollar Index(DXY) has rebounded firmly. The USD Index is shifting its auction profile above 103.70 after a recovery move as therisk aversiontheme has improved the appeal for safe-haven assets. S&P500 futures have reported losses in the Asian session ahead of the opening of the equity markets in theUnited Statesafter an extended weekend. The weekend was full of geopolitical tensions including the US-China tensions and missile attacks by North Korea near Japan’s Essential Economic Zone (EEC) region. The demand for US government bonds has also dropped, which has led to a jump in the 10-year yields to 3.86%. Going forward, the release of theEurozoneZEW Survey- Economic Sentiment will be keenly watched. The sentiment data is seen as negative at 29.7 vs. the positive figure of 16.7 released earlier. A pessimist view from the majority of institutional investors could impact the Euro ahead.

The recovery move by the USD Index in the Asian session was higher confident, however, further range extension is facing pressure. This week, the show-stopper will be the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, which will release on Wednesday. Investors are expecting a sheer hawkish stance on the interest rate guidance as Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers have been citing it would be premature considering a pause in the policy tightening spell this year. This has trimmed demand for US government bonds. Lower demand for government bonds has propelled the 10-year yields above 3.85%. Hawkish Reserve Bank of Australia minutes fail to support the Australian Dollar It was widely anticipated that Reserve Bank of AustraliaGovernor Philip Loweand his mates would be advocating for more interest rate hikes as Australian inflation is critically stubborn. The AustralianConsumer Price Index(CPI) has refreshed its multi-decade of 7.8% and is showing no signs of softening ahead in spite of the fact that the Official Cash Rate (OCR) has been already pushed to 3.35%. The message from the RBA minutes was clear that more interest rates are warranted as strong consumer demand is not allowing Australian inflation to soften from its peak. According to the RBA minutes, policymakers also considered the option of 50 basis points (bps) interest rate hike considering the persistence of inflation. The RBA members also highlighted that the Unemployment Rate is the lowest in the past 50 years and job vacancies are extremely high, which is delighting households for flushing surplus funds into the economy. Aussie PMI is out, US PMI is due yet Apart from the hawkish RBA minutes, upbeat preliminary Australian S&P PMI (Feb) data has also failed to strengthen the Australian Dollar. The Manufacturing PMI landed at 50.1, higher than the consensus of 49.9 and the former release of 50.0. The Services PMI scaled firmly to 49.2 versus the estimates of 48.4 and the prior release of 48.6. Economic activities in the Australian economy are accelerating despite higher interest rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia, which indicates that consumer demand is extremely robust. In Tuesday’s New York session, preliminary US S&P PMI numbers will be keenly watched. The Manufacturing PMI (Feb) is seen lower at 46.8 vs. the prior release of 46.9. And the Services PMI is seen at 46.6 against the former release of 46.8. There is no denying the fact that producers have trimmed their dependency on borrowings from commercial banks due to higher interest rates by the Federal Reserve. And are exploiting their retained earnings to avoid higher interest obligations. Firms have postponed their expansion plans, therefore, a continuation of contraction in economic activities is highly expected. FOMC minutes to guide further movement to the FX market ahead The minutes from the Federal Reserve will provide a detailed explanation of hiking interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) in the February monetary policy meeting. The street always tries to remain ahead of the Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers. Therefore, the major focal point for investors in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes is the meaningful cues that could provide guidance on interest rates. Information on the terminal rate and targets for inflation will be keenly watched. AUD/USD technical outlook  AUD/USDhas shifted its business above the neckline of the Head and Shoulder chart pattern plotted from January 10 low at 0.6860 on a four-hour scale. The responsive buying action from the market participants negated the downside break of the above-mentioned chart pattern. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6900 is acting as a cushion for the Australian Dollar. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has rebounded into the 40.00-60.00 range, which indicates a bullish reversal. A break into the bullish range of 60.00-80.00 will trigger the bullish momentum.

"Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia at UOB Group suggest a sustained decline inEUR/USDhas lost impulse as of late. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that EUR ‘is unlikely to weaken further’ and we expected it to ‘consolidate within a range of 1.0650/1.0720’. Our view was not wrong even though EUR traded within a narrower range than expected (1.0669/1.0704). The muted price actions offer no fresh clues and EUR could continue to consolidate, likely between 1.0660 and 1.0710.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have held a negative view in EUR since last Thursday. After EUR dropped to 1.0611 and rebounded strongly, we indicated yesterday (20 Feb, spot at 1.0685) that that downward momentum has waned somewhat and the likelihood of a sustained decline in EUR below 1.0615 is not high. We continue to hold the same view. Overall, only a breach of 1.0740 (no change in ‘strong resistance’ level from yesterday) would indicate that the current downward pressure has eased. To put it another, a breach of 1.0740 would indicate that EUR could consolidate and range trade for a period of time.”",0
"GBP/USDrisks a potential test of the 1.1900 region in the near term, according to Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia at UOB Group. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Our expectations for ‘the strong rebound in GBP to extend’ did not materialize as it traded in a quiet manner between 1.2015 and 1.2057 before closing largely unchanged at 1.2040. The price actions appear to be consolidative and GBP is likely to trade in a range today, expected to be between 1.1990 and 1.2060.” Next 1-3 weeks: “There is not much to add to our update from yesterday (20 Feb, spot at 1.2035). As highlighted, as long as the ‘strong resistance’ at 1.2100 (no change in level from yesterday) is not breached within the next few days, there is still a slim chance for GBP to break below 1.1900. A breach of 1.2100 would indicate that the weakness in GBP that started late last week has come to an end.”",0
"TheGBP/USDpair comes under some selling pressure on Tuesday and stalls its recent recovery from the 1.1915 area, or the lowest level since January 6, touched last week. Spot prices remain on the defensive through the early European session, though manage to hold above the 1.2000 psychological mark, at least for the time being. TheUS Dollarcontinues to draw support from rising bets for further policy tightening by theFedand looming recession risks. Apart from this, speculations that the Bank of England's (BoE) current rate-hiking cycle might be nearing the end undermine the British Pound and contribute to a mildly offered tone around the GBP/USD pair. The downside, however, remains cushioned as traders seem reluctant to place aggressive directional bets ahead of the release of the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday. Heading into this key event risk, the flash version of the PMI prints from the UK and the US could produce short-term opportunities around the GBP/USD pair on Tuesday. From a technical perspective, any subsequent downfall is likely to find decent support near the very important 200-day SMA, currently around the 1.1935 region. This is closely followed by last Friday's swing low, around the 1.1915 zone and the 1.1900 mark, which if broken decisively (being the bottom of a textbook hammer candlestick) should pave the way for a further depreciating move. Against the backdrop of the recent failures near the 1.2450 area, which constitute the formation of a bearish double top, the downfall will mark a fresh breakdown. The GBP/USD pair might then accelerate the slide towards the YTD low, around the 1.1840 region touched in January and extend the downward trajectory towards the 1.1800 round figure. On the flip side, the 1.2050-1.2055 region now seems to have emerged as an immediate hurdle. This is followed by the 1.2070-1.2075 resistance zone and the 1.2100 mark. A sustained strength beyond the latter has the potential to lift the GBP/USD pair beyond the 1.2130-1.2135 barrier, towards the 50-day SMA, currently around the 1.2170 area. The latter should act as a pivotal point, which if cleared could trigger a near-term short-covering rally. The GBP/USD pair might then reclaim the 1.2200 mark and climb further to the last week's swing high, around the 1.2265-1.2270 region, before aiming to reclaim the 1.2300 round-figure mark.

"It’s PMI day, and economists at ING think the Euro could benefit from the reinforcement of its growth story after a period of few domestic drivers. A reminder of the improved growth outlook “The Euro has been left without strong domestic drivers on the data front over the past week, so today’s PMIs will be watched quite closely. Consensus is leaning in favour of some modest improvement in both manufacturing and service gauges, and investors might see this as an opportunity to re-enter strategic medium-term long-EUR positions now that the Dollar correction seems to be losing momentum.” “Instability in globalrisk appetitetoday may delay the beneficial effects on EUR/USD today, but we still see the balance of risks tilted to the upside for EUR/USD in the coming days, and a return to the 1.0750-1.0800 range seems possible.” ",1

Key comments from Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global “February’s flash PMI survey showed the German private sector economy return to growth territory for the first time eight months, alongside continued resilience in the labor market and a further slight recovery in business confidence.” “Encouragingly, the increase in business activity was broad-based by sector. However, whereas the upturn in services activity was at least partly demand-related, higher manufacturing output owed almost exclusively to a substantial easing of supply-chain bottlenecks, which merely allowed goods producers to catch up on backlogs of work.” FX implications EUR/USDis keeping its downside momentum intact at around 1.0670 on the mixed German data.",0

No news on the macro scenario for the pair, which keeps tracking developments/messages from both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve when it comes to the next decisions on interestrates, particularly beyond the upcoming March events. In the calendar, Germany’s flash Manufacturing PMI is expected at 46.5 in February (from 47.3) and the Services PMI is seen at 51.3 (from 50.7). Later in the session, advanced PMIs are also due for the broader euro area followed by the Economic Sentiment tracked by the ZEW Institute in Germany and the Euroland. Earlier in the session, New Car Registrations in the EU expanded 11.3% in the year to January.  In the US, advanced Manufacturing and Services PMIs are due followed by Existing Home Sales and a 3-month/6-month Bill Auctions. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD loses further traction amidst the tepid bounce in the greenback on Tuesday, while the release of key results from fundamentals on both sides of the ocean are expected to grab all the attention. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB.

Comments from Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global “Business activity across the eurozone grew much faster than expected in February, with growth hitting a nine-month high thanks to resurgent service sector activity and a recovering manufacturing economy. February’s PMI is broadly consistent with GDP rising at a quarterly rate of just under 0.3%.” “Growth has been buoyed by rising confidence as recession fears fade and inflation shows signs of peaking, though manufacturing has also benefitted from a major improvement in supplier performance.” FX implications EUR/USDremains pressured toward 1.0650 following the release of the Eurozone PMIs.

"The AUD/USD pair comes under some renewed selling pressure on Tuesday and reverses a major part of the previous day's positive move. The pair remains depressed below the 0.6900 mark through the first half of the European session. The negative price action falls in line with the dominant short-term downtrend, evidenced in the albeit volatile declining peaks and troughs since the February 1 highs, which suggests the wind is behind bears, and more downside is, on balance, more likely than upside. A combination of factors weighs on the AUD/USD pair: theUS Dollaris being pushed higher by the prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve which is triggering a fresh leg up in the US Treasury bond yields and continuing to underpin the Greenback. Geopolitical risks eminating from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and US-China political manouveuring as well as softer equities further benefits the safe-haven buck and drives flows away from the risk-sensitive Aussie. Market sentimentremains fragile amid growing worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs which are also tempering investors' appetite for riskier assets of which the Aussie is one. Benefiting the buck is the fact that markets now seem convinced that the US central bank will stick to its hawkish stance and have been pricing in at least a 25 bps lift-off at the next two FOMC meetings in March and May. This was reaffirmed by the US CPI and PPI data last week, which showed that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. Furthermore, a slew of FOMC members stressed the need to keep liftingratesgradually to tame inflation. PerhapsFedhawkishness is overshadowing a more hawkish tilt from the recently released Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting minutes, as these failed to tempt bulls or lend any support to the AUD/USD pair. In fact, theRBAminutes showed that the Australian central bank had considered raising interest rates by 50 bps during its February meeting, though eventually settled on a 25 bps hike. The board of the Reserve Bank of Australia also agreed that more interest rate hikes are needed over the coming months to bring down inflation. Yet this has had little impact on the AUD/USD pair which is unable to attract any buyers and suggests that the recent pullback from a multi-month top is far from being over. Market participants now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of flash PMI prints and Existing Home Sales data later on Tuesday. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, could influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair. The focus, however, will remain glued to the latest FOMC meeting minutes, which will play a key role in determining the near-term trajectory. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0

"The USD/JPY pair regains positive traction on Tuesday and maintains its bid tone through the first half of the European session. The pair steadily climbs back closer to the 135.00 psychological mark and moves well within the striking distance of a nearly two-month high touched last Friday. TheUS Dollarbuying remains unabated amid firming expectations for further policy tightening by theFedand turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. In fact, the markets have been pricing in at least a 25 bps lift-off at each of the next two FOMC meetings in March and May in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. This, in turn, triggers a fresh leg up in the US Treasury bond yields and continues to underpin the Greenback. The Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, is weighed down by the disappointing release of the flash Manufacturing PMI from Japan, which fell more than expected to 47.4 in February. That said, a rise in the service sector activity, along with a generally softer risk tone, lend some support to the safe-haven JPY and cap gains for the USD/JPY pair. Themarket sentimentremains fragile amid looming recession risks and fresh geopolitical tensions. In the latest developments, North Korea launched two more ballistic missiles off its east coast on Monday after firing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the sea off Japan's west coast over the weekend. Furthermore, talks of Russia ramping up attacks in Ukraine temper investors' appetite for riskier assets. Traders also seem reluctant ahead of the newly nominated head of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda's testimony on Friday. In the meantime, the FOMC meeting minutes, due for release on Wednesday, will be looked upon for fresh clues about the US central bank's rate-hike path. This will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and help determine the next leg of a directional move for theUSD/JPY pair.

The analysts noted that the WIRP suggests 25 bp hikes in March, May, and June that takes Fed Funds to 5.25-5.50%.  ''Given how strong the data have been recently, we see growing risks of a fourth 25 bp hike that takes us up to 5.50-5.75%, though that is not being priced in yet.  This should eventually change,'' the analysts said. ''Strangely enough, an easing cycle is still expected to begin in Q4 but at much lower odds.  Eventually, it should be totally priced out into 2024 in the next stage ofFedrepricing.'' The next major catalyst will be the Federal Reserve's release of the minutes of its last meeting on Wednesday, which will give traders a glimpse of how high officials are projecting interestrateswill go following this impressive run of recent data for the first months of the year including stronger than expected jobs and inflation numbers. USD/JPY & DXY technical analysis In all of the above, it will be interesting to see how much further the US Dollar, DXY, can go:  We have seen a number of reactions from the recent lows over many months of history in the DXY index as the above illustrates, so why would it be any different this time around? 101.00 is a strong level of support so the thesis is higher from here, in the meanwhile at least.  The 38.2%Fibonacciretracement is eyed as the first target near 106.00 on a break of the prior month's highs of 105.35. Down on the weeklychart, 106 is a clear target and resistance area:  From a daily perspective, the 104.30s were pinned but there is room to go on the upside following the correction into old resistance that is now acting as a support structure. A continuation, therefore, can be anticipated to breach the space between today's highs and all the way to the start of the year's highs near 105.35:  USD/JPY technical analysis  This leaves a bullish bias on the US Dollar pairs and the Yen would be expected to weaken into the overhead USD/JPY four-hour resistance in the coming days.

"What you need to take care of on Wednesday, February 22: TheUS Dollarstands victorious across the FX board as risk aversion led the way. The market focus remained on geopolitical tensions as the conflict between the US and Russia escalated in the last 24 hours. The latest on the matter came from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said the United States suspectsChina is considering providing military support to Russia. Moscow responded by suspending its nuclear arms treaty with the US and pledging to maintain its military actions in Ukraine. Wall Street returned from the long weekend and followed the negative lead of their overseas counterparts. US indexes are sharply down, losing roughly 2% each. The slump was exacerbated by renewed price pressure concerns after the release of the US S&P Global PMIs. The Manufacturing and Services index came in better than anticipated. Still, the official report noted that ""firms continued to seek to pass on greater input costs to customers through hikes in output charges. The rise in selling prices was the quickest for four months and strong overall."" Continued inflationary pressures mean the US Federal Reserve will remain on the tightening path for longer. Annual inflation in Canada rose by 5.9% in January, down from 6.3% in December. Also, the Bank of Canada's Core CPI,  which excludes volatile food and energy prices,  was up by 5% on a yearly basis from 5.4% in December. United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Spokesperson said the prime minister had stated unequivocally that there are still substantive issues to be resolved with the EU, bringing back to the tableBrexit woes. Beyond US S&P Global PMIs, European ones were mixed, with the services sector expanding but the manufacturing one still in contraction mode. UK figures, on the other hand, were quite encouraging. EUR/USD trades at around 1.0650, not far from an early low at 1.0636.GBP/USDhovers around 1.2110, with the Pound supported by upbeat local data. Commodity-linked currencies are sharply down, with AUD/USD trading at 0.6855 and USD/CAD up to 1.3520. The USD/JPY flirts with 135.00, while USD/CHF trades at around 0.9270.

The market mood is quite negative ahead of the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. S&P500 witnessed a massive sell-off on Tuesday as the upbeat preliminary S&P PMI data bolstered the expectations of more rates by the Federal Reserve (Fed) ahead. Upbeat economic activities indicate that the demand for labor could accelerate further, which will result in higher consumer spending. This might propel the United States ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) ahead. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) climbed to near 103.90 amid the risk aversion theme. A solid case for the continuation of policy tightening by Fed chairJerome Powellsent yields on fire. The alpha generated on 10-year US Treasurybondsjumped to near 4%. Preliminary S&P Manufacturing PMI (Feb) climbed to 47.8 from the consensus of 47.3 and the former release of 46.9. The Services PMI soared to 50.5 from the estimates of 47.2 and the prior release of 46.8. For further guidance, the release of the FOMC minutes will be keenly watched. The FOMC minutes will provide the rationale behind hiking interestratesby 25 basis points (bps) to 4.50-4.75%. Additionally, cues about the interest rate guidance will be in focus. On the Australian front, after hawkish Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes, investors are focusing on the Labor Cost Index (Q4) data. On a quarterly basis, the economic data is seen steady at 1%. The annual data is expected to improve to 3.5% from the former release of 3.1%. Firms are offsetting the demand for labor by providing higher wages, which will keep Australian inflationary pressures at elevated levels. AUD/USD  ",0
"The EUR/USD pair has retreated after facing selling interest around 1.0650 in the early Tokyo session. The major currency pair remained extremely volatile as upbeat United States preliminary S&P PMI data resulted in accelerating odds for the continuation of the policy tightening spell by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Risk-perceived assets like S&P500 witnessed a vertical sell-off as upbeat US PMI data strengthened recession fears. TheFedis going to consider the rebound in the scale of economic activities as a threat to the declining trend in the ConsumerPrice Index(CPI), which will be addressed by more rate hikes. This pushed the alpha provided on the 10-year US Treasurybondsto 4%. Meanwhile, the upbeatEurozoneZEW Survey- Economic Sentiment failed to provide support to the Euro. Higher-than-anticipated sentiment data indicates that the majority of institutional investors are holding an optimistic view on the economic projections. The presence of potential sellers at the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement (placed from January 6 low at 1.0483 to February high at 1.1033) at 1.0693 is heavily deploying pressure on EUR/USD. This could drag the shared currency pair further. The 89-period (High-Low) Simple Moving Average (SMA) band is barricading the Euro consistently. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is on the verge of slipping into the bearish range of 20.00-40.00. An occurrence of the same will trigger a downside momentum. A decisive downside move below February 17 low at 1.0613 will drag the asset toward December 22 low at 1.0573. A slippage below the latter will extend the downside toward January 6 low at 1.0483. In an alternate scenario, a break above February 16 high at 1.0722 will drive the asset toward 50% Fibo retracement at 1.0758, followed by February 14 high around 1.0800.

"GBP/USD grinds higher past 1.2100, mildly bid around 1.2115 during the initial hours of Wednesday’s Asian trading, as upbeat UK fundamentals keep Cable buyers hopeful ahead of the key Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes. That said, strong UK data and hopes of overcoming multi-day-old nurse strikes in Britain seemed to have underpinned the GBP/USD pair’s latest run-up. However, upbeat US data and hawkishFedtalks also propelled the US Dollar and challenged the Cable buyers prior to the important Fed Minutes. TheBrexitwoes join the pre-event anxiety to act as additional filter towards the north. As per the preliminary readings of the UK S&P Global/CIPS data for February, the Manufacturing PMI rose to 49.2 versus 46.8 expected and 47.0 prior while Services PMI jumped to a seven-month high of 53.3 compared to 48.3 market forecasts and 48.7 previous readings. Following the upbeat data, Reuters quotes a survey of economists stating that the strength of the survey made it more likely that theBoE- grappling with an inflation rate still above 10% - would raise interestratesto 4.25% in March, despite further signs of easing price pressures in the PMI. Elsewhere, Reuters reported that nurses will pause strike action in England and begin talks with the British government on Wednesday in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said on Tuesday. Alternatively, Brexit woes loom as the Eurosceptic Conservatives challenge UK Prime Minister’s talks with the European Union (EU) over the Northern Ireland (NI) border issue. The leader of Northern Ireland's largest unionist party (Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party) said on Tuesday there was still work to be done to find a resolution to a dispute between Britain and the European Union over their post-Brexit trading arrangements with the province, per Reuters. On the other hand, the business activity in the United States matched the likes of previously published US inflation numbers, Retail Sales and employment data and boosted the US Dollar. Following the data, the FEDWATCH tool signals that the money market participants see the benchmark level peaking at 5.3% in July, and staying near those levels throughout the year, versus 5.10% expected by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). Other than the Fed bets, the upbeat US data also propelled the US Treasury bond yields as the benchmark 10-year bond coupon refreshed a three-month high near 3.95% while the two-year counterpart also jumped to the highest levels since early November 2022, to 4.73% at latest. As a result, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) snapped a two-day downtrend to regain 104.00 on Tuesday, grinding higher around 104.20 by the press time. Apart from the aforementioned catalysts, the challenges torisk appetiteemanating from Russia and China also underpin the US Dollar and test the GBP/USD prices ahead o the Fed Minutes. To sum up, Fed Minutes should be eyed for policy pivot talks considering the latest cautiously optimistic tone of the policymakers. Technical analysis Although the 200-DMA puts a floor under the GBP/USD price near 1.1935, a convergence of the 21-DMA and a three-week-old descending resistance line, close to 1.2165 at the latest, restricts short-term upside ofthe Cablepair.

As a result, the S&P Global Composite PMI surpassed 47.5 analysts’ consensus and 46.8 previous reading to mark 50.2 figure. Further, Japan’s wage talks and signals for higher payments to workers in Tokyo seem to underpin the need for hawkish Bank of Japan (BoJ) action even if the latest chatters favor Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s one last shot at the ultra-easy monetary policy before he retires in April. On the other hand, the FEDWATCH tool signals that the money market participants see the benchmark level peaking at 5.3% in July, and staying near those levels throughout the year, versus 5.10% expected by the US Federal Reserve (Fed).

"AUD/USD remains sidelined near 0.6860, printing mild gains by the press time of Wednesday’s Asian session, as bears take a breather following the biggest daily slump since the last Wednesday. Even so, the Aussie pair keeps the previous week’s retreat from a downward-sloping resistance line from February 02, as well as the 50-SMA, amid a bearish MACD signal. Also adding strength to the downside bias is the sustained trading below the support-turned-resistance line from late December 2022. However, an upward-sloping support line from the last Friday, close to 0.6850 by the press time, restricts the immediate downside of the AUD/USD pair. Following that, the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of the pair’s run-up from December 2022 to early February 2023, near 0.6830, will precede the monthly low of 0.6811 to challenge the AUD/USD bears before giving them control. On the contrary, the aforementioned three-week-old descending resistance line, near 0.6900, as well as the 50-SMA level of around 0.6910, guard short-term AUD/USD recovery ahead of the multi-day-old previous support line, close to 0.6935 at the latest.

It should be noted that the pair’s successful trading above 200-DMA joins the impending bull cross on the MACD to keep GBP/USD buyers hopeful. That said, the 50-DMA and a downward-sloping resistance line from late January, respectively near 1.2160 and 1.2200, restrict short-term GBP/USD upside.

"Bank of Japan (BoJ) board member Naoki Tamura is speaking at a scheduled event on Wednesday, noting that “Japan's consumer inflation is likely to slow pace of increase towards the latter half of next fiscal year.” Additional quotes For now, we must carefully, humbly look at how markets will stablize, to what extent market functions will improve. Widening of yield band in Dec was not aimed at tightening monetary policy. Financial transmission function being smoothly exerted for now. Personally feel that prolonged, massive easing may have curbed effect of market mechanism. At some point in the future, BoJ must conduct assessment of monetary policy framework, feasibility of its policy by looking at balance of benefits, costs. But for now, it is appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy. Japan's economy likely to recovery but uncertainty regarding outlook is extremely high. What's unique about recent price rises is that it is driven by change in corporate price-setting behaviour. There is a risk inflation could overshoot expectations. Japan has yet to see conditions where our 2% inflation is stably, sustainably achieved. What's important is whether positive economic cycle is achieved, in which price rises are accompanied by higher corporate profits, wage increases. I see fairly good chance strong wage hikes will be achieved in spring wage negotiations. Market reaction TheUSD/JPY pairkeeps its recovery mode intact toward 135.00 on the dovish comments.

"USD/JPY bulls take a breather as the quote drops to 134.70 while printing the mild losses, the first in four days, during early Wednesday. In doing so, the Yen pair portrays a U-turn from the upward-sloping resistance line from late December 2022. Given the overbought RSI (14) also assenting to the USD/JPY pullback, the intraday sellers are likely to have a bit longer good time. However, a convergence of the monthly resistance-turned-support line and an upward-sloping trend line from February 03, close to 134.00 at the latest, appears a tough nut to crack for the USD/JPY bears. In a case where the Yen pair sellers manage to conquer the 134.00 key support, the odds of witnessing a slump toward the 200-SMA level surrounding 131.00 can’t be ruled out. It should be observed that six-week-long horizontal support near 132.90 can act as a buffer during the anticipated fall towards 131.00. On the contrary, buyers need a successful break of the aforementioned multi-day-old resistance line from the last December, close to 135.20 by the press time, to keep the reins. Following that, the late 2022 peak surrounding 138.20 and the 140.00 psychological magnet may gain the market’s attention.

Yesterday, EUR dropped to 1.0636 before settling at 1.0646 (-0.34%). Downward momentum has increased, albeit not much. While EUR could break below 1.0615, it has to stay below this level before further weakness is likely. Overall, only a breach of 1.0725 (‘strong resistance’ level previously at 1.0740) would indicate that the weakness in EUR that started late last week has stabilized. Looking ahead, the next support level below 1.0615 is at 1.0570.”",0

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “The strong advance in GBP to a high of 1.2147 came as a surprise (we were expecting GBP to trade in a range). While overbought, the rapid rise could extend to 1.2165 before the risk of a pullback increases. The major resistance at 1.2210 is unlikely to come into view. Support is at 1.2065, followed by 1.2030.” Next 1-3 weeks: “In our most recent narrative from Monday (20 Feb, spot at 1.2035), we indicated that ‘as long as the ‘strong resistance’ at 1.2100 is not breached within the next few days, there is still a slim chance for GBP to break below 1.1900’. Yesterday, GBP soared to a high of 1.2147. The breach of the ‘strong resistance’ level indicates that the weakness in GBP that started late last week (see annotations in thechartbelow) has ended. The current price movements appear to be part of a broad consolidation range and GBP is likely to trade between 1.2000 and 1.2210 for the time being.” ",1

TheUS Dollarstands tall near a multi-week high amid hawkish Fed expectations and turns out to be a key factor weighing on the AUD/USD pair. In fact, the markets seem convinced that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates and have been pricing in at least a 25 bps lift-off at the next two policy meetings in March and May. The bets were lifted by strong US PMI on Tuesday, which showed that business activity unexpectedly rebounded to an eight-month high in February. The incoming robust US macro data points to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and supports prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed. Moreover, several FOMC members, including Fed ChairJerome Powell, recently stressed the need to keep raisingratesgradually to fully gain control of inflation. Hence, the market focus will remain glued to the release of the latest FOMC monetary policy meeting minutes, due later during the US session. Investors will look for clues about the Fed's rate-hiking path, which will drive the USD and provide a fresh directional impetus to the AUD/USD pair. In the meantime, looming recession risks, along with geopolitical tensions, further seem to act as a tailwind for the safe-haven buck and contribute to driving flows away from the risk-sensitive Aussie.

Support around 1.0640-1.0660 is enough of an encouraging sign “We think that, at this stage, support around 1.0640-1.0660 is enough of an encouraging sign for EUR/USD given the strength of the Dollar against other pro-cyclical currencies.” “A hawkish surprise in the FOMC minutes and/or more geopolitical risk being priced in would likely put the 1.0600 support at risk. But unless those two risks materialise, a good Ifo reading in Germany today and stabilisation in sentiment may actually start to favour a move back to 1.0700-1.0750 before the weekend.” ",1

Brexit remains an ongoing issue for the British economy “If the British economy were to stand up better than expected it would be easier for the BoE to continue its rate hike cycle as it would have to show less consideration for economic developments. This view seemed to dominate the market yesterday thanks to the positive leading indicators and economic developments.” “However, we are cautious to sound the all-clear at this stage. Due to high inflation levels, consumers are likely to remain cautious. Even if the rise of the index for the manufacturing sector is encouraging, it remains under the 50 mark, suggesting contraction.Brexitremains an ongoing issue for the British economy anyway.” “I am pleased Sterling has been allowed a bit of respite, but what will be decisive for the currency will be how restrictive the BoE will come across in March. Until then there will be a few more data publications and speeches by BoE members that might cause difficulties for Sterling again.” ",0

In the meantime, rising bets for additional interest rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) should lend support to the British Pound and help limit losses. The UK PMIs released on Tuesday indicated that business activity rose more than expected in February and fueled optimism that the country may be able to avoid a steep economic downturn.

"Over the past weeks, much has been written about the changes in the leadership of the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In the view of economists at Commerbznak, patience seems to be required as far as the BoJ is concerned. The market is going to consider Ueda’s comments very carefully “In view of an inflation rate that is high by Japanese standards – it reached 4% in January with the core rate standing at 3% with an upward trend – the market is going to consider Ueda’s comments very carefully. This might lead to erratic moves in JPY. I doubt that these will be sustainable.” “Only theBoJdecision in early March, still under Kuroda, might provide a first indication as to how monetary policy will develop if Kuroda really was to pave the way for his successor by widening the yield range. Otherwise, we will have to wait patiently until late April when Ueda will be running his first meeting. And even then, it is rather unlikely that Ueda would immediately turn everything in monetary policy inside out.” “In this respect, we will probably have to be patient with the BoJ as far as a possible turnaround in monetary policy is concerned.” ",1

The data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow theFedto keep raisingratesto control inflation.

Market participants this week will further take cues from the newly nominated head of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda's testimony on Friday.

Adding strength to the hawkish Fed Minutes were statements suggesting that a few participants favored a 50 basis point (bps) rate hike, while some believed there was an elevated risk of a recession in 2023. On the same line, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard also mentioned that theFedwill have to go north of 5% to tame inflation, as reported by Reuters. The policymaker also stated that he believes there are good chances they could beat inflation this year without creating a recession. The same suggests higher Fedratesfor longer and exerts downside pressure on the AUD/USD price. Additionally, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams also highlighted the hawkish Fed concerns and weighed on the AUD/USD as he said, “Fed is absolutely committed to getting inflation back to 2%.” It should be noted that downbeat prints of Australia’s WagePrice Indexfor the fourth quarter (Q4) join softer Q4 Construction Work Done and unimpressive Westpac Leasing Index for January to weigh on the AUD/USD price. Amid these plays, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) stretched its previous run-up to refresh the multi-day high while the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields retreat from their three-month high. Further, Wall Street closed mixed and should have put a floor under the AUD/USD.

"The GBP/USD pair has sensed a pause in the downside momentum after dropping to near 1.2040 in the early Asian session. It would be premature to consider a loss in the downside momentum for the Cable as higher volatility might stay ahead of the release of the preliminary United StatesGross Domestic Product(GDP) data for the fourth quarter of CY2022. The annualized economic data is seen stable at 2.9% The Cablewitnessed an intense sell-off in the late New York session after the release of the hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. Federal Reserve (Fed) chairJerome Powelland his mates are still reiterating higher interestratesfor a longer period to drag the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to a near 2% target. Fed policymakers are worried that China’s reopening after the rollback of lockdown curbs and ongoing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine advocate upside risks in inflation. Domestically, a labor shortage could propel a higher wage price index ahead. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures have shown a recovery in the Asian session. The 500-USstocksbasket futures have recovered their entire losses demonstrated on Wednesday. A sense of optimism has been observed in the overall risk aversion theme. The optimism could fade as President Joe Biden said it was a ""big mistake"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin to temporarily suspend Russia's participation in the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the two countries. Earlier, US Biden announced, “Russia was suspending its participation in the New START treaty, which implements caps on the number of nuclear weapons deployed by each country and inspections of nuclear sites,” as reported by ABC News. The Pound Sterling looks like it is struggling again as the recovery in manufacturing activities is insufficient to avoid the recession ahead. The preliminary United Kingdom manufacturing activities remained upbeat at 49.2, however, a figure below 50.0 is considered a contraction.

"USD/JPY grinds higher around 135.00 as bulls struggle to retake control, after a dismal daily close, despite broadUS Dollarstrength. The reason could be linked to the retreat in the Treasury bond yields ahead of today’s Japan holiday. It’s worth noting that the receding economic fears, mainly emanating from the recently firmer global economic data, not just from the US, seemed to have pushed back the bond bears. As a result, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields marked their first negative daily closing in three while retreating from the highest levels since early November, marked recently. That said, the latest prints of the US 10-year and two-year bond coupons are 3.93% and 4.70% respectively. Elsewhere, doubts about Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s ability to play a masterstroke of the dovish league before he retires in April also seemed to have probed the USD/JPY bulls. On the same line could be the recently firmer inflation and activity numbers from Japan. Above all, hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) concerns and geopolitical fears keep the USD/JPY bulls hopeful. US President Joe Biden thinks that his Russian counterpart isn’t up to using nuclear arms by backing off an international treaty. However, the fears surrounding the Ukraine-Russia war are far from over, with the latest edition of the West and China escalating the matter to the worse. That said, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently said that the US is considering the release of intelligence on China’s potential arms transfer to Russia. Earlier, comments from China's top diplomat Wang Yi and Russian President Putin weigh on the sentiment and underpinned the rush towards risk-safety, which in turn favored the USD/JPY bulls. China’s Diplomat Wang Yi met Russian President Vladimir Putin and said that they are ready to deepen strategic cooperation with Russia on Wednesday, as reported by Reuters. The Chinese policymaker also added that their relations will not succumb to pressure from third countries. Meanwhile, Putin noted that it's very important for them to have a cooperation with China and said he is looking forward to Chinese President Xi Jinping visiting Moscow. On the other hand, the latest Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes stated that all participants agreed more rate hikes are needed to achieve the inflation target while also favoring further Fed balance sheet reductions. On the same line, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard also mentioned that theFedwill have to go north of 5% to tame inflation, as reported by Reuters.

Additionally, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams highlighted the concerns favoring the Fed’s higherratesby saying, per Reuters, “Fed is absolutely committed to getting inflation back to 2%.” Against this backdrop, Wall Street closed mixed whereas the S&P 500 Futures remain mildly bid of late. Moving on, Japan’s holiday may restrict USD/JPY moves but the second estimations of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) details for the fourth quarter (Q4), as well as the preliminary readings of the US Q4Gross Domestic Product(GDP), will be important for fresh directions.

"GBP/USD renews its intraday high near 1.2060 as it consolidates the biggest daily loss in more than a during early Thursday. In doing so, the Cable pair rebounds from a one-week-long ascending trend amid hidden bullish RSI divergence. That said, the RSI (14) prints lower lows but the GBP/USD price prints higher lows, which in turn portrays a hidden bullish divergence and favors the quote’s latest bounce off the short-term key support line. However, the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of the pair’s January 2023 up-moves, near 1.2075, acts as a validation point for the pair’s further upside. Following that, the 200-bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA) level surrounding 1.2135 could challenge the GBP/USD bulls before directing them to the previous weekly high of near 1.2270. In a case wherethe Cablepair remains firmer past 1.2270, January’s top around 1.2450 will be in the spotlight. Alternatively, a downside break of the immediate support line, close to 1.2040 by the press time, could quickly recall the 1.2000 psychological magnet on thechart.

"EUR/USD prints mild gains around 1.0620 as it consolidates recent losses near the lowest levels in seven weeks during early Thursday. In doing so, the Euro pair cheers mildly positive sentiment in the market, as well as a lack of major data/events. That said, the major currency pair prints the first daily gain in four while bouncing off the lowest level since early January, marked the previous day, amid hopes from the latest economic data. Recently firmer global activity numbers and comments from the key central bank officials, mainly from the West, have raised hopes that the recession is less likely to happen. Even if it does in a certain part of the world, the effects will be mild and short-lived. Additionally favoring cautious optimism is the recent retreat in the US inflation expectations. That said, the 10-year and 5-year breakeven inflationratesfrom the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED) signal a pullback in the US inflation expectations by retreating from the multi-day top. Elsewhere, Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes stated that all participants agreed more rate hikes are needed to achieve the inflation target. The same initially triggered the market’s risk-off mood and favored the EUR/USD bears before the details suggested that the policymakers also discussed going easy on the rate hike trajectory. The same highlights softer inflation expectations as the key concern for the recent improvement in mood. The dual meaning of US President Joe Biden’s comments could also be held responsible for the latest mildly upbeat sentiment. As per the latest commentary from US President Joe Biden, he thinks that his Russian counterpart isn’t up to using nuclear arms by backing off an international treaty. However, the fears surrounding the Ukraine-Russia war are far from over, with the latest edition of the West and China escalating the matter to the worse. That said, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently said that the US is considering the release of intelligence on China’s potential arms transfer to Russia. Previously, the China-Russia ties seemed to have escalated the geopolitical woes as the US strongly criticized such moves and favored the rush towards risk safety. Talking about the mixed data from Europe, Germany’s IFO Business Climate improved to 91.1 for February versus 91.4 expected and 90.1 prior while the Current Assessment eased to 93.9 from 94.1 previous readings and analysts’ estimations of 95.00. Further, the IFO Expectations gauge rose to 88.5 compared to 88.3 market consensus and 86.4 prior. Following the release of theGerman IFO Business Survey, the institute’s Economist Klaus Wohlrabe said that the “German economy will not get around recession but it will be mild.” It should be noted that Germany’s inflation gauge, namely Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), confirmed 9.2% YoY initial forecasts. Against this backdrop, S&P 500 Futures bounce off the monthly low to print mild gains around 4,020 while the yields are mostly unchanged amid Japan’s holiday, following a retreat from the three-month high the previous day. Moving on, final readings of the bloc’s inflation gauge and risk catalysts will be important for the EUR/USD traders to watch ahead of the second readings of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) details for the fourth quarter (Q4), as well as the preliminary readings of the US Q4Gross Domestic Product(GDP). Technical analysis Unless bouncing back beyond the three-month-old support-turned-resistance, around 1.0740 by the press time, EUR/USD remains on the bear’s radar. Additional important levels  ",0
"USD/JPY renews intraday low near 134.70 during early Thursday as it prints the first daily loss in five heading into the European session. In doing so, the Yen pair remains depressed inside a one-week-old rising wedge bearishchartformation. That said, the latest RSI (14) retreat and multiple failures to remain firmer past 135.00 tease the USD/JPY sellers. However, sluggish RSI and MACD suggest low support for the bears. It’s worth noting that the 100-Hour Moving Average (HMA) joins the support line of the stated wedge to highlight the 134.50 as the short-term key support. Following that, the 200-HMA and a fortnight-long horizontal line, respectively near 133.80 and 132.90, could challenge the USD/JPY downside. In a case where the USD/JPY prices remain weak past 132.90, an ascending support line from February 02, close to 132.35 at the latest, appears as the last defense of the buyers. On the flip side, recovery moves need to stay successfully beyond the 135.00 round figure to convince USD/JPY buyers. Even so, the aforementioned wedge’s top line could challenge the upside momentum near 135.35 before giving control to the bulls. Overall, USD/JPY is likely to decline further but the downside room appears limited. USD/JPY: Hourly chart  Trend: Limited downside expected Additional important levels  ",0
"The AUD/USD pair has stretched its recovery to near 0.6840 in the Asian session. The Aussie asset has picked strength as investors have shrugged-off volatility inspired by the release of the hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes released in the late New York session. A sheer recovery has been observed in the S&P500 futures after a choppy Wednesday, portraying astellarrebound by the risk-appetite theme. The upbeat market mood has resulted in a meaningful correction in theUS Dollar Index(DXY). The USD Index has slipped firmly to near 104.00 despite the Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers in a hurry to reach the interest rate peak to bring down the inflationary pressures. Fed chairJerome Powelland his mates are worried that the strong labor market and a recovery in consumer spending could trigger a revival in the United States ConsumerPrice Index(CPI). The FOMC minutes conveyed that two policymakers Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard were not in favor of decelerating the pace of hiking rates again. Investors should be aware that the Fed also trimmed the policy tightening pace in December monetary policy meeting to 50 basis points (bps) after hiking interestratesfour times consecutively by 75 bps. Meanwhile, the absence of meaningful easing signals in the Australian inflation is bolstering the case of policy tightening continuation by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). On Wednesday, Australia’s Wage Price Index (Q4) was escalated by 0.8% lower than the consensus of 1.0% on a quarterly basis. This might have provided relief to theRBAas lower funds with households would result in lower spending.  However, more rate hikes cannot be paused as the current inflation is four times more than the desired target.

"GBP/USD witnesses a pullback from intraday high to 1.2060 heading into Thursday’s London open amid political and Brexit fears surrounding the UK. Also challenging the Cable buyers could be the broadly hawkish Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes and geopolitical woes concerning the Ukraine-Russia war. It’s worth noting, however, that the absence of Japanese traders and a light calendar limits the quote’s latest moves. UK Prime Minister (PM) Rishi Sunak realized how thorny the Brexit issue is when he faced bitter questions in the first PMQs in the parliaments on Wednesday. Not only the Opposition Leader Keir Starmer but the Conservatives were also pushing for no change in the Brexit deal surrounding the Northern Ireland (NI) protocol that was recently opened for discussion. The talks raised fears of a Theresa May-type fall of Sunak’s PM status and challengedthe Cablebuyers. In addition to theBrexitcall, the UK government’s negotiations with the nurse union also probed the GBP/USD buyers. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) held “intensive talks” with Health Secretary Stephen Barclay, per The Guardian, but other unions felt left out and the same raises risks of more strikes in the UK moving forward. Elsewhere, a retreat in the US inflation expectations, per the 10-year and 5-year breakeven inflationratesfrom the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED), joins mixed comments from US President Biden to probe the triggeredUS Dollarpullback earlier in the day. That said, inflation expectations gained major attention after Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes signaled that the policymakers discussed going easy on the rate hike trajectory if needed. However, the broad discussion on the need for more rate hikes and hawkish comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, as well as from Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams, challenge the dovish bias surrounding theFed. On the other hand, US President Biden said that he thinks that his Russian counterpart isn’t up to using nuclear arms by backing off an international treaty. However, the fears surrounding the Ukraine-Russia war are far from over, with the latest edition of the West and China escalating the matter to the worse.

"EUR/USD has stretched its recovery above 1.0620 in the early European session as the risk-taking ability of the market participants has improved firmly. The major currency displayed a confident recovery move from the round-level support of 1.0600 as investors digested the uncertainty associated with the context of policy tightening continuation by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to tame sticky inflation. S&P500 futures have shown sheer volatility in its recovery move after a rangebound Wednesday, portraying the risk-appetite theme. The positivemarket sentimenthas resulted in a correction in theUS Dollar Index(DXY) to near 104.00. At the time of writing, the USD Index is attempting a revival. The market mood could dampen as geopolitical tensions have not eased yet. China's top diplomat Wang Yi said on Wednesday that they are ready to deepen strategic cooperation with Russia, as reported by Reuters. He further added, ""Our relations will not succumb to pressure from third countries."" Earlier, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said China would cross a “red line” if the country decided to provide lethal military aid to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Investors ignore hawkish FOMC minutes The message from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes that the policy tightening spell will continue as a three-month decline in the United States ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) is insufficient to infuse confidence among the Federal Reserve policymakers that inflation will come down in an expected manner. Federal Reserve chairJerome Powelland other policymakers believe that the upbeat labor market and a recovery in the January Retail Sales data could trigger a revival in the US CPI ahead. The FOMC minutes conveyed that two policymakers Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard were not in favor of slicing the extent of the interest rate hikes again. In its December monetary policy meeting, the Federal Reserve trimmed the policy tightening pace to 50 basis points (bps) after hiking interestratesfour times consecutively by 75 bps. Talking about the external forces, the Federal Reserve believes that the rollback of pandemic controls by China and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war could also accelerate the price index in the US. European Central Bank sets to raise rates by 50 bps in March InEurozone, price pressures have fallen at a decent pace in the past few months after the continuous policy tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB). The central bank has already pushed interest rates to 3% in its February monetary policy meeting and further rate hike are on the table. No doubt, the price index is responding effectively to the restrictive monetary policy but a pause at this time could be a premature decision. European Central Bank PresidentChristine Lagardein his speech on Tuesday announced that the central bank is ready to hike interest rates further by 50 bps to 3.50% in March. The economy has managed to dodge the recession in CY2022 and now a decent recovery in Eurozone makes the decision of further rate hikes more constructive. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has come forward with an interest rate projection for the European Central Bank. The investment banking firm said in addition to an increase of 50 basis points in March and 25 basis points in May, it was estimating a 25 basis-point hike in June.

EUR subsequently edged lower before dropping below 1.0615 in NY trade (low has been 1.0597). Downward momentum has improved, albeit not much. We continue to expect EUR to weaken, even though any decline is expected to encounter solid support at 1.0570. On the upside, a break of 1.0655 (minor resistance is at 1.0625) would indicate that the weakness in EUR has stabilized.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have held a negative EUR view since late last week.

EUR took out 1.0615 in NY trade before closing at 1.0601 (-0.42%). The next support is at 1.0570; a clear break of this level could trigger a rapid drop, as the next significant support is some distance away at 1.0485.

Starting with the Yen positive headlines, the retreat in the US Treasury bond yields and inflation expectations, per the 10-year and 5-year breakeven inflationratesfrom the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED), seem to exert downside pressure on the USD/JPY price. On the same line are the receding fears of nuclear war as US President Joe Biden thinks that his Russian counterpart isn’t up to using nuclear arms by backing off an international treaty. Furthermore, hawkish concerns surrounding the Bank of Japan (BoJ), due to the nearness to the end of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s term, also weigh on theUSD/JPY pair. Alternatively, Fed policymakers are all in for further rate lifts, per the latest Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes, which in turn propels the US Dollar demand.

It’s worth noting, however, that the recovery remains elusive amid bearish MACD signals and the downbeat RSI (14). Adding strength to the downside bias is the AUD/USD pair’s sustained trading beneath the support-turned-resistance line from late December 2022.

"Eurostat will release theEurozoneHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for January on Thursday, February 23 at 10:00 GMT and as we get closer to the release time, here are the expectations forecast by the economists and researchers of four major banks regarding the upcoming EU inflation print. Headline is expected at 8.7% year-on-year vs. 8.5% in December while core is set to remain unchanged at 5.2%. On a monthly basis, the HICP in the old continent is expected to fall by -0.4% in the reported period while the core HICP is also seen down by -0.8%. Commerzbank “In the preliminary estimate of the euro area inflation rate for January, Eurostat statisticians apparently assumed a previous month's rate of change in the harmonised consumerprice indexof -0.1% for Germany. According to a preliminary estimate by the Federal Statistical Office, however, the index rose by 0.5%. This means that the consumer price index for the euro area did not fall by 0.4% in January, but only by 0.2%. The YoY rate of change is thus likely to be revised upwards from 8.5% to 8.6% or possibly even to 8.7%.” TDS “While EZ inflation data is rarely revised by much, we look for headline inflation to be revised up by 0.2ppts in Jan – which would mark the biggest revision since 2015. Our forecast (Headline 8.7%, Core 5.2% YoY) is primarily driven by the discrepancy between the actual and Eurostat's estimate of the delayed German inflation data, as Eurostat's estimate did not account for the major energy subsidy changes.” SocGen “With the delayed German inflation release printing at 9.2%, which is above the 8.5/8.6% estimate that we believe Eurostat used, the final euro area HICP figure may be revised up from 8.5% to 8.6%. For core and the other major components, there is more uncertainty over whether they will be revised, especially with Germany only releasing data on the headline figure.” Nomura “The flash estimate of January euro area HICP inflation printed at 8.5% YoY. This, however, assumed 8.6% YoY inflation for Germany; at the time of publication, German data were unavailable, so it required Eurostat to make an assumption. German headline inflation, meanwhile, subsequently printed at 9.2% YoY. According to our calculations, this should push euro area headline HICP inflation for January up to 8.7% YoY, and push euro area core HICP inflation for January to 5.3% YoY (from 5.2% YoY in the flash estimate).” ",0

Rising bets for additional interest rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) act as a tailwind for the British Pound. This, along with a modestUS Dollarpullback from a multi-week high, lends some support to the GBP/USD pair. A slight improvement in the global risk sentiment - as depicted by a generally positive tone around the equity markets - undermines the safe-haven buck. That said, a combination of factors should help limit deeper losses for the Greenback and cap the upside for the major. Investors remain worried about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. This, along with geopolitical tensions, should keep a lid on any optimism in the markets. Apart from this, growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates to tame persistently high inflation favours the USD bulls. In fact, the FOMC meeting minutes released on Wednesday showed that a few participants even favoured raisingratesby 50 bps or they could have supported it. Moreover, the US CPI and PPI data released last week showed that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. Adding to this, the recent robust US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow theFedto stick to its hawkish stance. In the absence of any relevant UK economic data, the fundamental backdrop makes it prudent to wait for a strong follow-through buying around the GBP/USD pair before positioning for further intraday appreciating move. Traders now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of the Prelim (second estimate) Q4GDPprint and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims later during the early North American session.

"In the opinion of Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group,USD/JPYis expected to remain bid while above the 134.00 level in the short term. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that ‘despite the strong advance, there has been no significant increase in upward momentum and USD is unlikely to strengthen much further’. We expected USD to consolidate between 134.20 and 135.20. Our view of consolidation was not wrong even though USD traded within a narrower range than expected (134.35/135.06). Upward momentum has firmed somewhat and USD is likely to edge higher today. However, any advance is unlikely to break the major resistance at 135.50. Support is at 134.60, a breach of 134.35 would indicate that the build-up in momentum has faded.” Next 1-3 weeks: “On Monday (20 Feb, spot at 134.35) we highlighted that USD could consolidate for a couple of days before heading higher to the next target at 135.50. It has been a couple of days but there is no sign that USD is ready to head higher to 135.50. However, upward momentum appears to be firm and the risk is still to the upside. Only a break of 134.00 (‘strong support’ level was at 133.60 yesterday) would indicate that the USD strength that started in the middle of last week has come to an end. Looking ahead, if the USD breaks decisively above 135.50, the next level to watch is 137.00.”",0
"The USD upside correction is ending. Economists at Société Générale expect the greenback to weaken again. The trend has been for the UK and Eurozone to do better than the US “In relative terms, Europe lagged the US recovery, and the UK lagged the Eurozone, but now, the trend has been for the UK andEurozoneto do better than the US. That’s not reflected in all the data, but it is why the underlying trend has been for the EUR/USD to recover and theEUR/GBPto edge slowly higher.” “The Dollar may have fallen too fast, and the rate re-think has triggered a recovery.

"Sellers keep the price action around the European currency subdued and promptEUR/USDto pierce the 1.0600 support to clock new multi-week lows on Thursday. EUR/USD focuses on USD, data EUR/USD puts the 1.0600 neighbourhood to the test amidst the continuation of the gradual decline on Thursday, always against the backdrop of the relentless march north in the greenback. Indeed, the pair navigates an area last traded during the first week of the new year amidst the equally, albeit in the opposite direction, uptick in the greenback to new multi-week highs in the 104.66/70 band. No news around the pair leaves the ongoing speculation of the Fed’s tighter-for-longer stance as the exclusive driver of the sentiment around the pair for the time being, while expectations of a 50 bps rate hike by the ECB and a 25 bps raise in the Fed Funds Target Range by the Fed, both due in March, appear firm. In the domestic calendar, final figures of the inflation during January in the broader Euroland will be the salient event on this side of the Atlantic, while another revision of the Q4 GDP Growth Rate, Initial Claims and the Chicago Fed National Activity Index will be in the limelight later in the NA session. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD loses further traction and slips back to the sub-1.0600 region, or multi-week lows, on Thursday. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB.

Short-term momentum rising sharply “USD/JPY has rebounded from our first target of the ‘neckline’ to the multi-year base and 50% retracement of the 2020/2022 uptrend at 127.53/27 and with short-term momentum rising sharply, we expect slightly further short-term strength up to 136.67/95, which we would then expect to cap.” “Post this recovery, we expect a sustained break below 127.27 and then the 126.36 May 2022 low in due course, which should see weakness extend to the 61.8% retracement at 121.44 later on in the year.” ",1
"The USD/JPY pair plods higher on Thursday, finally pushing above the 135.00 psychological mark during the second half of the European session. Spot prices push above the YTD peak, around the 135.20-135.25 region, continuing 2023's steady-eddy rally. Assuming Thursday ends on a positive note (above 135.20) a short-term bullish continuation pattern will be confirmed, with a relatively high probability of a march higher to a potential target at around 136.25-50 or roughly 100 pips higher. TheUS Dollaris seen consolidating its recent gains to a multi-week high, which, in turn, acts as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair. The downside, however, remains cushioned, at least for the time being, amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interestratesto tame stubbornly high inflation. In fact, the FOMC minutes released on Wednesday showed that a few members favoured raising the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 bps or they could have supported it. Adding to this, St. LouisFedPresident James Bullard noted the need to get inflation on a sustainable path toward target this year. This comes after the US CPI and PPI data indicated last week that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. Moreover, the US data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs, which should allow the Fed to stick to its hawkish stance. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and lends some support to the Greenback. Furthermore, a modest recovery in the global risk sentiment, which tends to undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY), supports prospects for a further appreciating move for the USD/JPY pair. That said, traders seem reluctant to place aggressive bets and prefer to wait for the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor candidate Kazuo Ueda's testimony on Friday.  Ueda's view on the future of yield curve control (YCC) and super-easy monetary policy should drive the JPY and provide a fresh impetus to the pair. In the meantime, traders on Thursday will take cues from the US economic docket, featuring the release of the Prelim (second estimate) Q4GDPprint and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims. This, along with the US bond yields, will drive the USD demand. Apart from this, the broader risk sentiment should contribute to producing short-term trading opportunities around theUSD/JPY pair. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the major is to the upside. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1
Economists at Bank of America Global Research believe that the EUR/USD pair could retest 2022 closing lows around 0.98-1.00. A bottom in Q1 would reduce the risk of retesting the 0.9800-1.00 area “We’d be remiss to not mention that when Euro forms a bottom below 1.15 it tends to retest the monthly closing lows at least once. This means the risk of a retest of the 2022 closing lows in 1H23 still can’t be ruled out to form a bigger bottom.” “If the new downtrend in the dailychartforms a bottom in Q1 then the risk would be reduced. We don’t have that yet. The monthly closing lows is in the 0.9800-1.00 area.” ,1
"The AUD/USD pair trims a part of its modest intraday gains and retreats to the lower end of the daily range during the first half of the European session. Spot prices, however, manage to hold above the 0.6800 mark, representing a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), and remain at the mercy of theUS Dollarprice dynamics. In fact, the USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, stands tall near a multi-week high amid the prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed. The bets were reaffirmed by hawkish FOMC meeting minutes released on Wednesday, showing that policymakers were determined to raiseratesfurther to tame stubbornly high inflation. Furthermore, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard pointed to the need to get inflation on a sustainable path toward the target this year. It is worth recalling that the US CPI and PPI data indicated last week that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. Moreover, the recent upbeat US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow the US central bank to stick to its hawkish stance. This, in turn, remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and underpins the buck. That said, a modest recovery in the risk sentiment lends support to the risk-sensitive Aussie. Even from a technical perspective, the AUD/USD pair has been showing some resilience near the very important 200-day SMA support, currently around the 0.6800 mark. This makes it prudent to wait for a sustained break through the said handle before positioning for an extension of the recent pullback from the highest level since June 2022 touched earlier this month. The focus now shifts to the US economic docket - featuring the Prelim Q4GDPprint and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data. Apart from this, comments by influential FOMC members - AtlantaFed President Raphael Bosticand San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, along with the US bond yields and the broader market risk sentiment, will drive the USD demand and provide some meaningful impetus to the AUD/USD pair.

"TheGBP/USDpair meets with a fresh supply following an intraday uptick to the 1.2075 region and drops to a fresh daily low during the late-European session. Spot prices have leaked lower all session despite multiple attempts at a rebound and are now trading just below the 1.2020 mark. TheUS Dollarremains pinned near a multi-week high, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor exerting some downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. A swathe of US data out today presented a mixed picture. On the one hand Q4 GDP came out at 2.7%, and was below expectations of 2.9% and Q3's 3.2%, suggesting the economy was slowing at a faster rate than expected, raised fears rising borrowing costs might be impacting on growth. This suggests a less hawkish approach is likely from the US Federal Reserve - which would be negative for the USD. Whilst on the other, the Core PCE Prices, the Fed's prefered gauge of inflation, showed signs of price stickiness, coming out at 4.3% in Q4, which was above the 3.9% forecast by economists but still below the 4.7% of Q3. This might encourage a more hawkish bias for the Federal Reserve in its wrestle with inflation, which would be US Dollar positive. The CME FedWatch Tool is showing that markets are now pricing in a 73% probability of at least a 25 bps lift-off at the next three FOMC policy meetings, and a 27% chance of a higher 50 bps rise. Hawkish expectations are assisting the US Treasury bond yields to hold steady near the YTD peak and continue to underpin the Greenback. That said, a modest recovery in the global risk sentiment - as depicted by a generally positive tone around the equity markets - keeps a lid on the safe-haven buck. Apart from this, rising bets for additional interest rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) contribute to limiting losses for the GBP/USD pair. Survey data from the CBI today further supported theoutlookfor the UK economy after showing a higher-than-expected result in the Distributive Trades survey of (2) versus the (-13) forecast and the previous (-23). Indeed, the UK PMIs released on Tuesday indicated that business activity rose more than expected in February and fueled optimism that the country may be able to avoid a steep economic downturn. This, in turn, could persuade the BoE to keep its foot on the accelerator in its race against inflation. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a sustained break below the 1.2000 mark before confirming that the GBP/USD pair's recent bounce from a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) has already run out of steam. Next on tap is the US economic docket, featuring the release of the Prelim (second estimate) Q4GDPprint and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims.

"TheUSD/JPY paircatches some bids during the early North American session and jumps to a fresh YTD peak, around the 135.35 region in the last hour. The latest leg of a sudden spike follows the upbeat US data, which showed that Initial Jobless Claims unexpectedly fell to 192K during the week ended February 17. This further points to the underlying strength in the US labour market, which, along with persistently high inflation, should allow the Fed to continue hiking interestratesfor longer. This, to a larger extent, offsets a downward revision of the US Q4 GD, which showed that the world's largest economy expanded by a 2.7% annualized pace against the 2.9% rise estimated previously. Nevertheless, hawkishFedexpectations remain supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and continue to lend support to theUS Dollar. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the USD/JPY pair higher. Apart from this, a modest recovery in the global risk sentiment - as depicted by a generally positive tone around the equity markets - undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and provides an additional boost to the major. The momentum could also be attributed to some technical buying above the 135.00 psychological mark. It, however, remains to be seen if bulls can capitalize on the move or opt to lighten their bets as the market focus now shifts to the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor candidate Kazuo Ueda's testimony on Friday. Investors will closely scrutinize Ueda's view on the future of yield curve control (YCC) and super-easy monetary policy.

"The GBP/USD tumbles below the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as Wall Street prepares for Thursday’s close, with decent gains on a risk-on impulse. In the FX space, theUS Dollar(USD) exerts pressure on most G8 currency pairs, particularly the Pound Sterling (GBP). At the time of writing, the GBP/USD is trading at 1.2018, below its opening price. After hitting a daily high of 1.2074, the GBP/USD retreated and broke below 1.2036, the 100-day EMA, on its way to the day’s lows at 1.1991. However, the GBP/USD recovered some ground and reclaimed the 1.2000 figure as the US Dollar softened. From a dailychartperspective, the GBP/USD is neutral to downward biased, with all the long-term EMAs resting above the spot price. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at bearish territory aims south, indicating that sellers are gathering momentum. Therefore, GBP/USD downside is expected. If the GBP/USD falls below the 1.2000 figure, the next support would be the weekly low of 1.1985. A breach of the latter will expose a support trendline that passes around the February 14 low of 1.1914. That will set the stage for GBP/USD sellers to regain 1.1900.

"AUD/USD fails to defend the late Thursday’s corrective bounce off a seven-week low, dropping back to 0.6807 during early Friday in Asia, as markets await the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred inflation gauge. In addition to the pre-data anxiety, hawkish Fed concerns and geopolitical fears surrounding China and Russia also weigh on the risk barometer pair. As per Thursday’s US data dump, the second reading of the Gross Domestic Product Annualized, better known as Real GDP, eased to 2.7% for the fourth quarter (Q4) versus 2.9% first forecasts. However, the PersonalConsumption Expenditure(PCE) Price and Core PCE for the said period rose to 3.7% and 4.3% QoQ versus 3.2% and 3.9% respective first estimations. Additionally, the ChicagoFedNational Activity Index improved to 0.23 in January from -0.46 (revised), versus 0.03 analysts’ estimates. On the same line, Initial Jobless Claims also eased to 192K for the week ended on February 17 from 195K (revised) prior, compared to 200K expected. Hence, the latest set of the US data has been in accordance with the upbeat economics released so far in February and has helped the US Dollar to remain firmer, after early Thursday’s retreat. On the other hand, comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signaled that the US will resume discussions with China on economic issues 'at an appropriate time' whereas China’s Commerce Ministry urged the US to create good conditions for trade with China. The news managed to trigger the pair’s bounce off a multi-day low on Thursday. On the same line were statements from China’s commerce ministry spokesperson who said, the recovery momentum in the country’s consumer market was strong in January while also adding, “The government will take more measures to revive and expand consumption.” However, the latest headlines suggesting China’s readiness to supply combat drones to Russia and the US Senators’ push to halt Chinese carriers overflying Russia on US flights seem to renew the market fears and weigh on the AUD/USD prices. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed mildly positive and the US Treasury bond yields retreat from the three-month high but theUS Dollar Index(DXY) remains firm ahead of the key data. Moving on, qualitative headlines may entertain the AUD/USD traders ahead of the key US data. That said, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index is expected to have risen by 4.9% YoY in January, versus 5% prior. Further, the more relevant Core PCE Price Index, known as Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, is likely eased to 4.3% YoY, compared 4.4% prior.

Japan's economy is recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. But uncertainty regarding the economy, prices and markets is extremely high. Consumer inflation is at 4%, above the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) target, but the rise is driven mostly by rising import prices. The rise is not driven by strong demand."" ''Consumer inflation is likely to fall below 2% in the latter half of the next fiscal year. It takes time for the effect of monetary policy to appear on the economy. It's standard practice to act preemptively to demand-driven inflation, but not respond immediately to supply-driven inflation. Otherwise, theBOJwill be cooling demand, worsening economy and pushing down prices by tightening monetary policy."" ''Japan's trend inflation is likely to rise gradually. But it will take some time for inflation to sustainably and stably achieve the BOJ's 2% target.'' ""With the BOJ's current policy, Japan is no longer in a state described as deflation. It's true there are various side-effects emerging from the stimulus. But the BOJ's current policy is a necessary, appropriate means to achieve 2% inflation."" ''Government and Bank of Japan need to closely communicate with each other.''''Want to grasp not only macroeconomy but also microeconomy including small firms.''''To continue monetary easing to realise wage hikes.''''Want to appropriately liaise with other central banks and communicate with markets.''''Enhancing labour productivity is becoming more important given limit to labour supply.''''Inflation rate is peaking out.''

"The EUR/USD pair rebounded firmly after dropping below 1.0580 in the late New York session. The major currency pair has recaptured the round-level resistance of 1.0600 and is looking to sustain above the same. The shared currency pair has shown some resilience as the demand for US Treasurybondshas improved. Investors are showing some interest in the US government bonds as volatility associated with the context of further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to tame stick inflation is cooling off. This has led to a decline in the 10-year US Treasury yields to 3.87%. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) corrected to near 104.20 and is expected to remain on the tenterhooks ahead of the release of the United States PersonalConsumption Expenditure(PCE) Price Index data. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures have recovered a majority of their recent losses displayed in the early Asian session, portraying a recovery in therisk appetitetheme. A strong labor market and a revival in consumer spending in the United States economy have confirmed that inflationary pressures are persistent and it would be premature to announce victory in the battle against stubborn inflation. Therefore, the street is expecting more rates from Fed chairJerome Powellahead. Economists at TD Securities expect two more interest rate hikes in March and May. On theEurozonefront, investors have shifted their focus toward the release of the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data. Analysts at SocGen expect “With the delayed German inflation release printing at 9.2%, which is above the 8.5/8.6% estimate that we believe Eurostat used, the final euro area HICP figure may be revised up from 8.5% to 8.6%. For core and the other major components, there is more uncertainty over whether they will be revised, especially with Germany only releasing data on the headline figure.” The European Central Bank (ECB) is continuously making efforts in bringing down inflationary pressures by hiking interestrates. Goldman Sachs has come forward with an interest rate projection for the European Central Bank. The investment banking firm said in addition to an increase of 50 basis points in March and 25 basis points in May, it is estimating a 25 basis-point hike in June. EUR/USD  ",1
" GBP/USD picks up bids to reverse the early Asia losses, despite failing to gain traction above 1.2000. That said,the Cablepair seesaws around 1.2020-25 during Friday morning, following a two-day downtrend. The quote’s latest weakness could be linked to the bear’s fears of strong support ahead as the 200-DMA and 100-DMA join an upward-sloping support line from late November 2022 to challenge the pair’s further downside near the 1.1940-20 area. It’s worth noting, however, that the bearish MACD signals and the steady RSI (14) keep the GBP/USD sellers hopeful. As a result, the quote’s further downside appears to have limited room unless breaking 1.1920 key support. In that case, a slump to the previous monthly low of 1.1840 becomes imminent before highlighting the mid-November 2022 swing low near 1.1760. Should the GBP/USD bears keep the reins past 1.1760, the last October’s high of 1.1645 may return to thechart. On the contrary, a three-week-old descending resistance line restricts immediate Cable moves near 1.2140, a break of which could quickly propel the pair towards the mid-February swing high of near 1.2270.

In doing so, the Aussie pair seems to cheer the latest headlines from China and Japan as they tame the previous risk-off mood. However, fears surrounding Russia and the US-China ties join hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) concerns to keep a tab on the bulls. Comments from the Japanese government's nominee for the new central bank governor, Kazuo Ueda, seem to offer enough volatility to the yields. The reason could be linked to the incoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor’s statements which initially defended the easy money policy before showing readiness for tightening in case inflation pressure accelerates. On the same line, China’s push for a cease-fire in the Ukraine-Russia war, as well as the signing of a deal to supply combat drones, seem to flash mixed geopolitical signals. On the same line, the US Senators’ push to halt Chinese carriers overflying Russia on US flights renews the market fears but the readiness to open dialogue with Beijing, as per the comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, challenges risk-aversion.

" EUR/USD seeks clear directions as it seesaws within a 25-pip trading range during early Friday, easing to 1.0600 by the press time. In doing so, the major currency pair portrays the market’s anxiety ahead of the key data/events, while also struggling to justify the mixed geopolitical headlines surrounding Ukraine. Recently, China unveiled a 12-point proposal and called for a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine but failed to gain accolades from the major global economies due to its ties with Moscow. In that regard, the EU Delegation Head in China stated that China should fulfill its responsibility to defend the UN (United Nations) charter in face of aggression by Russia. Previously, the market’s fears that the strong US data and further Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hikes are already priced in seemed to have weighed on the US Treasury bond yields and favored the EUR/USD rebound. However, geopolitical fears and doubts over the European Central Bank’s (ECB) next move seems to probe the pair traders of late. “Fed funds futures are priced for 25 basis-point (bp) hikes over the next three meetings, with a peak rate of 5.36% hitting in July,” per Reuters. At home, confirmation of the record-high core inflation data at home and easing recession woes seem to keep the Euro buyers hopeful. Elsewhere, US Senators’ push to halt Chinese carriers overflying Russia on US flights renews the market fears but the readiness to open dialogue with Beijing, as per the comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, challenges risk-aversion. Furthermore, China’s Commerce Ministry urged the US to create good conditions for trade while also showing readiness to take more measures to revive and expand consumption.

Moving on, final readings of Germany’s fourth quarter (Q4)Gross Domestic Product(GDP) and GfK Consumer Confidence data could entertain EUR/USD ahead of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index data for January. That said, The PCE Price Index is expected to have risen by 4.9% YoY in January, versus 5% prior. Further, the more relevant Core PCE Price Index, known as Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, is likely eased to 4.3% YoY, compared 4.4% prior. To sum up, EUR/USD trades on thin ice ahead of the key data/events but the bearish bias seems more lucrative. Technical analysis Monday’s Doji near multi-day low joins nearly oversold RSI (14) to favor a corrective bounce toward the December 2022 peak surrounding 1.0740. That said, a convergence of the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and an 11-week-old ascending support line, close to 1.0550 by the press time, appears a tough nut to crack for the EUR/USD bears.

At the time of writing, the pair is demonstrating a back-and-forth action around 134.70 and is expected to continue to remain sideways till the release of the United States PersonalConsumption Expenditure(PCE) Price Index for fresh impetus. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is struggling to find a decisive move as investors have shifted to the sidelines ahead of the US PCE data. S&P500 futures have turned volatile amid dubious gestures from the Chinese government toward the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The war situation between Russia and Ukraine has entered in the second year and the street is expecting some bold moves from Russia, which could accelerate geopolitical tensions further. Earlier, the United States and Germany warned Beijing not to deliver weapons to Russia, as reported by DER SPIEGEL. The warning from the US and Germany came after the headlines of negotiations between China and Russia for the purchase of 100 strike drones by Moscow. Bank of Japan Ueda cites current monetary policy as appropriate The street was keenly awaiting the speech fromBoJUeda as the Japanese administration promised that the government will consider an exit from the decade-long expansionary monetary policy with the novel Bank of Japan’s leadership. Bank of Japan Ueda cleared that the decade-high inflation is backed by higher import prices and has nothing to do with the domestic demand and labor cost index, which are extremely weak. Bank of Japan Ueda cited the current policy easing as appropriate to achieve pre-pandemic growth levels. Apart from that, the Bank of Japan Ueda cited that the central bank will look for normalization of the stimulant monetary policy after confidently achieving the 2% inflation target. The BoJ Kuroda successor refrained from discussing specifics of the Yield Conversion Control (YCC) for now. Investors should be aware that the Bank of Japan stretched the YCC on the Japanese GovernmentBonds(JGBs) to 0.5% from above and below zero in its December monetary policy. Context of a pause in Federal Reserve’s policy tightening spell looks over After a quarter of sheer inflation softening in the United States, the street started anticipating that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would pause the rate hike cycle for a while and would allow the current monetary policy to tame the stubborn inflation. However, the US inflation turned out to be extremely persistent and started showing its true colors. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) looks set to rebound after a declining spell led by the tight labor market and a solid revival in consumer spending. The upbeat labor market is characterized by declining jobless claims, multi-decade lowest Unemployment Rate, and rising demand for fresh talent if we sideline some lay-off announcements by giant techies.

The Chinese economy has failed to infuse confidence in the Western allies that the government is supporting a truce between Russia and Ukraine despite releasing the 12-point peace plan.

On the United Kingdom front, the need for further policy restriction is deepening as the economy has managed to dodge the recession in CY2022 and now the economicoutlookis improving again due to a revival in consumer spending.

Our view was not wrong as EUR edged to a low of 1.0575 in NY trade before recovering slightly to end the day little changed at 1.0595 (-0.06%). While downward momentum has not improved much, the bias for EUR is still on the downside even though it remains to be seen if it can maintain a foothold below the major support at 1.0570. On the upside, a breach of 1.0640 (minor resistance is at 1.0620) would indicate that the current downward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from yesterday (23 Feb, spot at 1.0600) still stands. As highlighted, EUR is likely to weaken further. A break of the major support at 1.0570 could trigger a rapid drop, as the next significant support is some distance away at 1.0485.

The BEA announced on Thursday that it revised the annualized realGross Domestic Product(GDP) growth for the fourth quarter to 2.7% from 2.9%. On a positive note, weekly Initial Jobless Claims stayed below 200,000 for the sixth straight week, reminding investors of tight labor market conditions. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) edged higher after this data but the improving market mood, as reflected by considerable gains in Wall Street's main indexes, limited the DXY's upside. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year US Treasury Bond yield lost nearly 1% on Thursday and declined below 3.9% early Friday. US Core PCE Inflation Preview: US Dollar selling opportunity?Three reasons to expect a slide. EUR/USDregistered small losses on Thursday. The pair stays in a consolidation phase at around 1.0600 in the early European session. The data from Germany revealed that the GDP contracted by 0.4% on a quarterly basis in the fourth-quarter, compared to the initial estimate of -0.2%. Following some fluctuations during the Asian trading hours,USD/JPYholds steady below 135.00 in the European morning. Incoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Friday that the weak Japanese Yen was good for exports, inbound tourism and some service sectors. Ueda, however, also acknowledged that the weak Yen was impacting household negatively. ""We would need to normalize policy if inflation makes headway towards 2% target,"" Ueda further noted. GBP/USDclosed the second straight in negative territory on Thursday but managed to hold above 1.2000. The pair stays relatively quiet early Friday. Goldprice touched its lowest level of 2023 below $1,820 on Thursday but erased its daily losses amid retreating US T-bond yields. XAU/USD moves sideways at around $1,825 on Friday. Bitcoindeclined for the third straight day on Thursday and continued to edge lower early Friday. BTC/USD was last seen trading at around $23,900.Ethereumregistered small losses on Thursday but lost its recovery momentum near $1,700.

"Downward momentum is expected to pick up pace onceGBP/USDleaves behind the 1.1950 level in the next few weeks, note UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Market Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that ‘while there is room for GBP to weaken further, it is unlikely to break the major support at 1.2000’. The anticipated weakness exceeded our expectations as it dropped to 1.1993 before rebounding slightly. Downward momentum has improved a tad and GBP is likely to edge lower today but it is unlikely to threaten the support at 1.1950. Resistance is at 1.2040, a breach of 1.2065 would indicate that the current mild downward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Two days ago (22 Feb, spot at 1.2115), we held the view that ‘the current price movements appear to be part of a broad consolidation range’ and we expected GBP to trade between 1.2000 and 1.2210. Yesterday, GBP dipped below 1.2000 as it dropped to 1.1993. Downward momentum is showing signs of building but GBP has to break the major support at 1.1950 before a sustained decline is likely. The chance of GBP breaking below 1.1950 is low at this stage, but it would remain intact as long as GBP stays below 1.2105 within the next few days.”",0
"In the opinion of UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Market Strategist Quek Ser Leang,AUD/USDcould slip back to the 0.6730 region in the near term. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we held the view that AUD could test 0.6775 before stabilization is likely. However, AUD did not quite test 0.6775 as it rebounded from a low of 0.6783. Despite the lackluster downward momentum, we continue to see room for AUD to test 0.6775 before a more sustained rebound is likely. On the upside, a breach of 0.6845 (minor resistance is at 0.6825) would indicate that 0.6775 is unlikely to come into view.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have expected AUD to weaken since late last week. In our update from yesterday (23 Feb, spot at 0.6810), we indicated that AUD is likely to weaken further to 0.6775, possibly 0.6730. We continue to hold the same view. All in all, only a breach of 0.6890 (no change in ‘strong resistance’ level) would indicate that AUD is not weakening further.",0
"The AUD/USD pair struggles to capitalize on the previous day's late bounce from a nearly two-month low and attracts some sellers near the 0.6825 region on Friday. Spot prices remain on the defensive around the 0.6800 mark through the early European session, with bears making a fresh attempt to extend the downtrend below a technically significant 200-day SMA. A combination of supporting factors keeps theUS Dollarpinned near a multi-week top, which, in turn, is seen acting as a headwind for the AUD/USD pair. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve remain supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and continue to underpin the USD. Apart from this, the prevalent cautious market mood benefits the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and weighs on the risk-sensitive Aussie. The FOMC meeting minutes released on Wednesday showed that officials were determined to raise interestratesfurther to fully gain control over inflation. Moreover, the incoming upbeat US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs. In fact, the US Initial Jobless Claims unexpectedly fell last week and indicated a still-tight labor market. This should allow theFedto stick to its hawkish stance for longer. The USD bulls, however, seem reluctant and prefer to wait for the release of the US CorePCEPrice Index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. The data will play a key role in influencing market expectations about the Fed's future rate-hike path. This, in turn, should drive the USD demand in the near term and provide a fresh directional impetus to the AUD/USD pair. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to register losses for the second successive week. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0
"According to UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Market Strategist Quek Ser Leang, odds for further gains to the 135.50 inUSD/JPYseem to be shrinking. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected USD to edge higher yesterday but we were of the view that ‘any advance is unlikely to break 135.50’. While our view for a higher USD was not wrong, instead of edging higher, it popped to a high of 135.36 in NY trade before pulling back sharply. The pullback is gathering momentum, and the bias is to the downside today. However, it remains to be seen if USD can break the strong support at 134.00. Resistance is at 134.80, followed by 135.20.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have held a positive USD view for more than a week now. As USD struggles to reach our objective of 135.50, we highlighted yesterday (23 Feb, spot at 134.95) that the risk for USD is still on the upside and only a break of 134.00 would indicate that USD strength has come to an end. USD subsequently popped to 135.36 before pulling back sharply. Upward momentum is waning rapidly and the likelihood of USD breaking 135.50 has diminished. In other words, the USD strength appears to be coming to an end, but confirmation will come with a break of 134.00.”",0
"Focus remains on US monetary policy for the time being. Economists at Commerzbank discuss the USDoutlookagainst the Euro. Rate expectations for the US already quite high “Speculation as to how the rate decision in March will go and how much further the Fed will move might remain the dominant drivers for USD and thus for the EUR/USD for now. However, it might get increasingly difficult for USD to gain further ground against the Euro. A lot has already been priced in and it is going to get difficult to further fuel the market’s expectations that have already moved a long way.” “The EUR side of things also plays a part. The question of how far monetary policy tightening is going to go also arises for theECB. The publication of the final consumer price data yesterday, in which the core rate was revised to the upside a little further to 5.3%, reminded everyone that the ECB too has quite a bit of work ahead of it.” “The focus currently remains on the Fed and on how far interestratesin the US will rise. The USD, therefore, seems to be decisive in providing momentum. However, that can change again very quickly.” ",0
"European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker and Bundesbank Chief Joachim Nagel said on Friday, he “can't rule significant further rate hikes after March.” Additional quotes “Latest data shows core inflation still too high.” “ECB must be determined in tightening policy.” “Can't rule out headline inflation has reached plateau but it's too speculative to say.” Market reaction The Euro failed to capitalize on the hawkish remarks. The EUR/USD pair is trading at 1.0588, down 0.05% on the day.",0
"GBP/USDclosed in negative territory on Thursday but managed to hold above 1.2000. Support levels at 1.1850/1950 are set to hold in the next few weeks, economists at ING report. A good week for UK data “Following Tuesday's strong PMI release, the UKoutlookhas received another boost today in the form of a big jump in GFK consumer confidence. This has now returned to levels not seen since last April.” “Slightly better growth prospects, sticky inflation and some further monetary tightening are the story across the US, theEurozoneand the UK at the moment – suggesting bilateral FX rates do not need to move too much. “Three-month GBP/USD implied volatility has drifted under 10% and would tend to favour more modest moves in the spot. We think support levels at 1.1850/1950 may hold over the next couple of weeks.” ",0
"USD/JPY holds steady below 135.00. As a normalisation of monetary in Japan policy is set to take some time, economists at Commerzbank expect the Yen to struggle against the USD. Fluent transition seems likely “The future chair of theBoJKazuo Ueda pointed out that inflation was unlikely to remain at high levels for long and that the central bank should continue its expansionary course. Ueda signalled that the transition to a new governor was probably going to be smooth. A sudden change in monetary policy, therefore, does not seem that likely.” “A renewed appreciation of the JPY against USD should remain difficult for now. The market is likely to remain nervous as speculation that under the current governor Kuroda another adjustment of monetary policy in connection with yield curve control might be made could continue, causing increased volatility in JPY.” ",1
"TheUSD/JPY pairrallies around 140 pips from the 134.00 neighbourhood on Friday and climbs above the two-month high touched the previous day. The pair currently trades above the 135.00 psychological mark and seems poised to build on the positive momentum. The Japanese Yen (JPY) did get a minor boost on the last day of the week after data released earlier today showed that Japan's core consumer inflation hit a new 41-year high in January. The initial reaction, however, fades rather quickly in reaction to the incoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda's dovish remarks. Addressing the parliament for the first time since his nomination, Ueda said that the recent rise in consumer inflation was driven mostly by surging import costs of raw materials, rather than strong domestic demand. Ueda added that the BoJ's current ultra-loose monetary policy stance is a necessary and appropriate means to steadily meet the 2% target. In contrast, the Federal Reserve is expected to stick to its hawkish stance. In fact, the FOMC minutes released on Wednesday showed that officials were determined to raise interestratesfurther to fully gain control over inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields, which, in turn, keeps theUS Dollarpinned near a multi-week high and further lends support to the USD/JPY pair. The aforementioned fundamental backdrop supports prospects for a further near-term appreciating move. The technical picture remains biased towards bullish bets as the pair continues to inch higher, setting higher highs with each day, and continuing the uptrend that began at the start of the year. Momentum indicators such as the RSI , moreover, are still supportive of further gains as they still remain out of the overbought zone. The USD bulls, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets and wait for the release of the US CorePCEPrice Index- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. The data should influence expectations above the Fed's future rate-hike path and drive the USD demand, providing some impetus to the USD/JPY pair. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to register gains for the second straight week and the fourth week in the previous five. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1
"Sellers remain well in control of the mood around the European currency and keepEUR/USDdepressed in the 1.0590 region at the end of the week. EUR/USD weaker ahead of US PCE, Fedspeak EUR/USD retreats uninterruptedly since Monday and navigates the area of multi-week lows in the 1.0590/80 band on Friday amidst a mild but constant bid bias in the greenback and generalized prudence ahead of the release of key US data later in the session. The persevering decline in the pair remains propped up by the better tone in the dollar, which in turn appears bolstered by speculation of the Fed’s tighter-for-longer stance and higher US yields. In the domestic calendar, finalGDPGrowth Rate in Germany showed the economy expanded 0.9% YoY in the October-December 2020 period, while Consumer Confidence tracked by GfK “improved” to -30.5 for the month of March. In France, Consumer Confidence eased to 82 in February (from 83). Across the ocean, the release of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge – the PCE and CorePCE– will be the salient event seconded by Personal Income/Spending, New Home Sales and the final Michigan Consumer Sentiment print. Additionally, FOMC Governor P.Jefferson (permanent voter, centrist) and Cleveland Fed L.Mester (2024 voter, hawk) are also due to speak. What to look for around EUR Price action around EUR/USD remains subdued and forces the pair to keep business in the lower end of the recent 6-weeks trading range. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB. Key events in the euro area this week: Germany Final Q4 GDP Growth Rate/GfK Consumer Confidence (Friday).

"The GBP/USD pair pierces the 1.2000 psychological mark on Friday, continuing the previous day's slide and reaching a new weekly low. The prevalent bullish sentiment surrounding theUS Dollarahead of US Core PCE prices seems to act as a the primary downside catalyst for this move. In fact, the USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, stands tall near a multi-week high amid the prospects for further policy tightening by theFed. The bets were reaffirmed by the FOMC minutes released on Wednesday, which showed that officials were determined to continue lifting interestratesto fully gain control over inflation. Moreover, the incoming upbeat US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow the US central bank to stick to its hawkish stance. The expectations remain supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and continue to underpin the buck. Apart from this, a softer risk tone - amid looming recession risks and geopolitical tensions - is seen as another factor benefitting the safe-haven Greenback and caps the upside for the GBP/USD pair. That said, rising bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) lend some support to the British Pound and act as a tailwind for the major. Traders also seem reluctant and now seem to have moved to the sidelines ahead of the release of the US CorePCEPrice Index- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. The crucial data will influence market expectations about the Fed's future rate-hike path. This, in turn, should drive the USD demand and provide a fresh directional impetus to theGBP/USDpair, making it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before placing fresh bearish bets. From a technical perspective the pair remains trapped in broad consolidation range within a medium-term uptrend, that began at the prior year's September lows. The cieling of this range lies at 1.2440 and the base at 1.1850. In addition, the 100 and 200-day SMAs are meeting in a nexus of support just below price in the 1.1920-30s, and any moves down will likely meet demand at that level, suggesting downside may be limited. Even if they are broken, the range floor at 1.1850 is likely to provide a further backstop to any runaway bear moves. To the upside, meanwhile, the 50 DMA at 1.2145 is likely to provide similar resistance. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
"USD/JPY has surpassed the 135 level. Economists at Société Générale analyze the pair's technical picture. 130/129.80 should be a crucial support “Sellers stay sidelined after neutral comments by Ueda on policy and inflation.” “Projection at 135.50 is next resistance. An initial pullback is not ruled out, however, recent pivot low at 130/129.80 should be a crucial support.” “Cross above 135.50 can lead to an extended bounce toward the 200-DMA at 137.00/137.70.” See:USD/JPY could hit the 136/137 area over the next couple of weeks – ING ",1

"EUR’s leak lower continues. Economists at Scotiabank expect the EUR/USD pair to continue under downside pressure for the time being. Scope for EUR gains is very limited “ECB hawks are responding to this week’s data showing upward revisions to Jan CPI data and a record rate of core inflation. Hawkish comments may slow EUR losses against the USD in the near term but the USD’s overall yield advantage suggests – for now – that a lower EUR/USD remains the most likely outcome.” “Technicals suggest firm resistance at 1.0610/15 intraday, with the EUR really needing to regain 1.07+ to stabilize.” “Broader technical patterns still point to a drop in the EUR to 1.0461 (retracement support from the EUR’s recent 0.95/1.10 rally).” ",0
Comments from Kazuo Ueda who was speaking in the Lower House of Parliament have failed to provide hawkish trigger for fresh gains. Economists at MUFG Bank note that the Yen is vulnerable to further correction lower. No clear hawkish signal to fuel a renewed pick-up in speculative demand for JPY “The comments appear broadly in line with the BoJ’s current policy communication although at the margin they may disappoint those who are looking for a bigger/more imminent further shift in BoJ policy settings under his leadership.” “There was no clear hawkish signal to fuel a renewed pick-up in speculative demand for the Yen in the near-term. It leaves the Yen vulnerable to further a correction lower while yields outside of Japan are rising again in anticipation that theFedand other major central banks may have to deliver more rate hikes to bring inflation back down.” “USD/JPY is currently testing resistance at the 135.00 level which if broken would open the door for the pair to rise back up towards the 200-Day Moving Average that comes in at just over the 137.00 level.” ,1
"TheUSD/JPY pairis seen building on its strong intraday rally from the 134.00 mark and scaling higher through the early North American session. The momentum picks up pace in reaction to the stronger-than-expected USPCEPrice Index and lifts spot prices to 136.00 neighbourhood, or the highest level since December 20. In fact, the US Bureau of EconomicAnalysisreported this Friday, that inflation in the US, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, rose 0.6% in January. Furthermore, the yearly rate edged up to 5.4% from the 5.3% previous, beating estimates for a fall to 4.9%. Additional detail of the report showed that Core PCEPrice Index- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - climbed 0.6% MoM and 4.7% over the past twelve months, again surpassing expectations. The data indicates that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped and reaffirms expectations for further policy tightening by the Fed. Moreover, the recent upbeat US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow theFedto stick to its hawkish stance. This, in turn, remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields, which keeps theUS Dollarnear a multi-week high and acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY. The Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, is weighed down by dovish remarks from the incoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda. In fact, Ueda said that the BoJ's current ultra-loose monetary policy stance is a necessary and appropriate means to steadily meet the 2% target. This is seen as another factor boosting the USD/JPY pair, though the prevalent risk-off mood could underpin the safe-haven JPY and keep a lid on any further gains, at least for the time being.

PCE inflation data fuels USD rally Earlier in the day, incoming Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said that a weak Japanese Yen would support exports, inbound tourism and some service sectors. Ueda added that they would need to normalize the monetary policy if inflation makes headway toward 2%. Since the data from Japan revealed that the National Core CPI edged higher to 4.2% on a yearly basis in January from 4% in December, these comments failed to help the Yen gather strength.

As a consequence, the 2-year Treasury yield jumped to the highest since November at 4.79% and the 10-year moved toward 4%. The dollar on Friday accelerated to the upside also boosted by a deterioration inmarket sentiment. The GBP/USD broke decisively below 1.2000.

It is falling for the third consecutive day. “Should the pair yield a daily closing below the critical support around the 1.1940 level, where the 100 and 200 DMAs (Daily Moving Averages) converge, a sharp sell-off toward the 1.1900 round figure will be in the offing. Further south, the 2023 low of 1.1841 will be next on sellers' radars”, writesDhawni Mehta, Analyst at FXStreet.

"The EUR/USD pair is juggling in a narrow range above 1.0540 in the early Asian session. The major currency pair is likely to show more weakness after surrendering the immediate support of 1.0540 ahead.

"AUD/USD prints mild gains around 0.6735 during the initial Asian session on Monday as bears take a breather around the lowest levels since early January following a two-week downtrend. In doing so, the Aussie pair traders seem to brace for this week’s key data amid a lack of major directives. However, the hawkish Fed concerns and strong US data kept bears hopeful even as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) officials signalled more rate hikes ahead. That said, the last week’s RBA Minutes and comments from RBAGovernor Philip Lowe, as well as Deputy Governor Guy Bullock, signalled further rate lifts are on the table. However, the hawkish concerns at the Aussie central bank weren’t as strong as those at the Federal Reserve (Fed), which drowned the AUD/USD pair. It should be noted that theUS Dollar Index(DXY) marked a four-week uptrend by the end of Friday, grinding near the highest levels in seven weeks of late, as strong US data, especially relating to inflation, underpinned hawkish Federal Reserve concerns. Among them, Friday’s US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) gained major attention as the headline PCE Price Index rose to 5.4% YoY versus 5.3% prior and 4.9% market forecasts. Further, the more relevant Core PCE Price Index, known as Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, rose to 4.7% YoY, compared to 4.6% prior and analysts' forecast of 4.3%. On the other hand, ClevelandFedPresident Loretta Mester told CNBC on Friday that his funds' rate was above the median in December and still thinks they need to be somewhat above 5%. The policymaker also added that inflation risks still tilted to the upside. On the same line, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Susan Collins said, “More rate hikes needed to deal with 'too high' inflation.”  Furthermore, Governor Philip Jefferson said, “Wage growth in the US is running too high to be consistent with a timely and sustainable return to the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation objective.” It’s worth mentioning that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also highlighted the US inflation concerns on the sideline of the Group of 20 (G20) meetings and backed the US Dollar bulls. Apart from the US data and hawkish Fed concerns, the geopolitical fears surrounding Russia and China also weighed on the AUD/USD price due to its ties with China and the pair’s risk-barometer status. In the last week, China released its 12-point peace plan on the Ukraine-Russia war but failed to gain accolades due to its ties with Russia. Following that, Germany’s Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on the sidelines of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors' meeting on Friday that there cannot be any business as usual with Russia as long as this war continues. On the same line, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday, “Sanctions are sharply eroding Russia's economic base.” EU’s von der Leyen also stated that China has already taken sides with Russia; they have to view their principles in that light. Against these plays, Wall Street benchmarks posted the biggest weekly fall in 2023 while the US two-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels since early November 2022. AUD/USD traders should focus on the risk catalysts ahead of this week’s US ISM Manufacturing PMI, Services PMI, Durable Goods Orders and China’s official PMIs. Also important to watch will be Aussie Retail Sales and monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January, as well as the fourth quarter (Q4)Gross Domestic Product(GDP).

During the weekend, ECB PresidentChristine Lagardesaid, “ECB must make sure inflation returns to 2%,” during an interview with Helsingin Sanomat. On the same line, ECB policymaker and Bundesbank Chief Joachim Nagel said on Friday he “can't rule significant further rate hikes after March.” It should be noted that the previous weekly releases of theEurozoneinflation numbers have also tried to recall the EUR/USD buyers. However, the comparatively stronger US data and hawkish Fed comments seemed to have gained more attention and drowned the quote. Also adding strength to the downside bias were the geopolitical concerns surrounding Russia and China.

Politico reports fresh sanctions on Russia from the US, the UK, and the European Union (EU states) after a clash between Poland and Italy held up the process for days. On the other hand, Reuters came out with the news suggesting Russia’s halting of oil flow to Poland via the Druzhba pipeline. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures remain indecisive even as Wall Street benchmarks posted the biggest weekly fall in 2023.

" AUD/USD licks its wounds while printing mild gains around 0.6735-40, bouncing off a seven-week low during early Monday’s sluggish session. In doing so, the Aussie pair rebounds from a convergence of the 100-DMA and an upward-sloping support line from late November 2022. The corrective move also justifies the nearly oversold RSI (14). However, the recovery remains elusive unless providing a daily closing beyond the 200-DMA hurdle of 0.6800. Following that, a downward-sloping resistance line from February 02, close to 0.6850 at the latest, acts as the last defense of the AUD/USD bears, a break of which could propel prices towards the 0.7000 round figure. Should the Aussie pair buyers keep the reins past 0.7000, tops marked during the mid-February, as well as the monthly high, surrounding 0.7030 and 0.7160 in that order, could lure the upside momentum. Meanwhile, a daily closing below 0.6730 could quickly drag AUD/USD toward a late December 2022 low near 0.6630. However, lows marked during November 21 and 11, around 0.6585 and 0.6575 could challenge the bears afterward.

That said, the US 10-year Treasury yields print mild losses around 3.93% while the two-year counterpart retreat from the highest levels since November 2022 as bond traders flirt with a 4.82% level at the latest. It should be noted that the mixed concerns surrounding the incomingBoJboard seemed to have also challenged the USD/JPY buyers. Previously, the easing hawkish concerns about incoming Governor Kazuo Ueda propelled the Yen pair. However, mixed comments from the Deputy Governor Nominees, namely Ryozo Himino and Shinichi Uchida, seemed to have probed the dovish bias surrounding the Japanese central bank afterwards.

"Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor designate Kazuo Ueda is shedding more light on the monetary policy during his appearance on Monday. Key quotes Possible to push up prices, wages with monetary easing. Trend inflation must heighten sharply for boj to shift to monetary tightening. It's not as if I have no ideas on how to tweak policy in future, but what exactly the BoJ will do will change depending on future economic developments. Interest rates remain low under current monetary easing, helping corporate investment. Monetary policy alone cannot raise prices immediately . Inflation is not determined by monetary policy alone. If external shock is big and prolonged, big monetary easing may not necessarily lead to price rises. BoJ-govt joint statement's mention of need for govt to sustain market trust in long-term finances is important. BoJ has purchased JGBs as part of efforts to achieve 2% inflation target. Japan's trend inflation, which BoJ bases monetary policy on, is positive but below 2%. Weak Yen boosts global firms' profits, but hurts firms reliant on imports and households. It's true lowering interest rates on savings hurts consumers while bringing down mortgage loans supporting households. If maintaining current policy does not push up trend inflation, we need to come up with more sustainable monetary policy, or monetary easing framework. Current easing is aimed at meeting 2% inflation target so this doesn't mean to pursue monetary easing to give rise to vicious inflation. Fact that BoJ’s bond buying is increasing recently is due partly to fact that inflation expectations are heightening. If achievement of BoJ’s price target comes into sight, boj will gradually reduce bond buying. If current easing doesn't cause trend inflation to rise, may need to consider more sustainable monetary easing steps. Many other countries adopt 2% inflation target. Changing 2% inflation target into 1% target would strengthen Yen short-term, weaken the currency long-term. Market reaction TheUSD/JPY pairwas last seen trading at 136.31, down 0.11% on the day.",1
"EUR/USD bears poke the 1.0540-30 support confluence surrounding the seven-week low amid the lackluster markets heading into Monday’s European session. In doing so, the major currency pair struggles to justify hawkish European Central Bank (ECB) concerns ahead of the key US data and geopolitical events. That said, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) grinds near an intraday high of around 105.30 following the initial pullback from a seven-week high. The US Dollar’s recent run-up could be linked to the strong US Treasury bond yields, as well as hawkishFedtalks and fears of more geopolitical tension surrounding Ukraine. It’s worth noting that upbeat US inflation-linked data from the US joined the Fed policymakers’ support for higher rates to propel the Fed fund futures to above 5.30%, versus 5.10% expected by the US central bank in December. The same joins the latest bout of sanctions on Russia from the West to escalate the market’s fears of a more geopolitical burden on the bloc, which in turn increases the odds of a recession in the Old continent even if the policymakers have been against the same of late. It’s worth observing that ECB PresidentChristine Lagardeadvocated the need for higherratesduring the weekend while speaking to the Helsingin Sanomat. On the same line,ECBpolicymaker and Bundesbank Chief Joachim Nagel said on Friday, he “can't rule significant further rate hikes after March.” Amid these plays, the US 10-year Treasury yields reverse the early-day losses to around 3.95%. Further, the two-year counterparts jump back towards the highest levels since November 2022, marked the previous day, as bond bears poke the 4.83% level by the press time. Further, the S&P 500 Futures lick its wounds with mild gains after the Wall Street benchmark posted the biggest weekly slump of 2023. Moving ahead, the start of the U.N. Human Rights Council session in Geneva becomes crucial for the EUR/USD pair watchers ahead of the US Durable Goods Orders for January, expected -4.0% versus 5.6% prior. Considering the downbeat expectations from the US data, the pair sellers may witness further hardships in breaking the 1.0540-30 key support. Technical analysis An 11-week-old ascending support line joins the 200-bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to highlight the 1.0540-30 as the key support for the EUR/USD bears to watch during the quote’s further downside. That said, oversold RSI conditions add strength to the stated support zone. Additional important levels  ",1
"The AUD/USD pair has refreshed its seven-week low near the round-level support of 0.6700. More downside in the Aussie asset looks favored as investors are channelizing their funds into theUS Dollar Index(DXY). Investors are favoring investment in the USD Index to dodge volatility inspired by a revival in consumer spending in the United States and escalating geopolitical tensions. The USD Index has refreshed its day’s high above 104.90 and is expected to recapture the 105.00 resistance. Western nations are still concerned about the rumors of China’s support to Russia in providing arms and ammunition against Ukraine. United States National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” China’s stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine puts it in an “awkward” position internationally and any weapons support to Russia would come with “real costs.” Risk-perceived assets like S&P500 futures are facing heat of the geopolitical tensions. The 500-stocks futures basket has surrendered the majority of gains earned in morning, portraying further strengthening of the risk-aversion theme. Meanwhile, the return generated on 10-year US Treasury yields is hovering around 3.94%. Higher-than-projected US consumer spending in January has highlighted the fact that the battle between the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the sticky inflation is getting brawled further. Fed chairJerome Powellhas been left with no other option than to tap hawkish measures to bring down the stubborn inflation. On the Australia front, recession fears are escalating as inflation is not showing signs of deceleration, which is bolstering the case of further policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). This week, Australia’sGross Domestic Product(GDP) (Q4) numbers will be keenly watched. The quarter GDP is seen higher at 0.9% vs. the former release of 0.6%. This might create more troubles for RBAGovernor Philip Loweas higher activities will favor further hikes. AUD/USD  ",0
"Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group hinted at the likelihood thatEUR/USDcould revisit the 1.0485 level in the next few weeks. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Our view last Friday was that ‘the bias for EUR is still on the downside even though it remains to be seen if it can maintain a foothold below the major support at 1.0570’. EUR cracked 1.0570 easily and dropped to 1.0534 before settling at 1.0546 (-0.46%). While downward momentum is showing tentative signs of slowing, EUR could dip to 1.0520 before stabilizing. The major support at 1.0485 is unlikely to come into view today. On the upside, a breach of 1.0600 (minor resistance is at 1.0580) would indicate that the weakness in EUR has stabilized.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have expected EUR to weaken for more than a week now. In our latest narrative from last Friday, we indicated EUR ‘is likely to weaken further’. We added, ‘a break of the major support at 1.0570 could trigger a rapid drop, as the next significant support is some distance away at 1.0485’. EUR took out 1.0570 in Ldn trade even though the subsequent decline was not as sharp as expected. However, as long as EUR stays below 1.0625 (‘strong resistance’ level was at 1.0670 last Friday), it is likely to continue to weaken toward 1.0485.”",0
"In the opinion of Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group,GBP/USDis expected to accelerate losses on a break below the 1.1870 level. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted last Friday that GBP ‘is likely to edge lower’ but we held the view that ‘the support at 1.1950 is unlikely to come under threat’. The anticipated decline exceeded our expectations as GBP cracked 1.1950 and dropped to 1.1928. Despite the decline, downward momentum has not increased much. That said, GBP is likely to weaken further even though a sustained decline below 1.1915 is unlikely (next support is at 1.1870). Resistance is at 1.1975, followed by 1.2000.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Last Friday (24 Feb, spot at 1.2020), we highlighted that ‘downward momentum is showing signs of building but GBP has to break the major support at 1.1950 before a sustained decline is likely’. We did not quite expect the rapid increase in downward momentum as GBP cracked 1.1950 in NY trade and dropped to 1.1928. While the price actions suggest the risk for GBP is on the downside, it has to crack another major support at 1.1870 before it can continue to decline. The downside risk is intact as long as 1.2050 (‘strong resistance’ level was at 1.2105 last Friday) is not breached.”",0

CHF is likely to be less in demand as a safe haven “With theECBlikely to raise its key rate more strongly by the middle of the year, we see depreciation pressure on the Swiss Franc against the EUR in the coming months.” “Moreover, due to easing concerns about an energy crisis and recession in Europe, the CHF is likely to be less in demand as a safe haven.” “The depreciation potential of the Franc is likely to remain limited in view of theSNBand possible interventions against an excessively weak franc though, especially if the inflation picture should cloud over again contrary to our forecasts.”  Source: Commerzbank Research ",1
"AUD/USDcould extend the decline to the 0.6680 region in the short-term horizon, note Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted last Friday that ‘despite the lackluster downward momentum, we continue to see room for AUD to test 0.6775 before a more sustained rebound is likely”. While our view for AUD to weaken was correct, instead of testing 0.6775, AUD plummeted to a low of 0.6719 before closing on a weak note at 0.6726 (-1.20%). Further AUD weakness is not ruled out but in view of the deeply oversold conditions, any decline today is unlikely to threaten the major support at 0.6680. On the upside, a breach of 0.6785 (minor resistance is at 0.6760) would indicate that the weakness in AUD has stabilized.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our most recent narrative was from last Thursday (23 Feb, spot at 0.6810), where we indicated that AUD ‘is likely to weaken further to 0.6775, possibly 0.6730’. Our view turned out to be correct as AUD plummeted to a low of 0.6719 on Friday. Theoutlookin AUD remains weak and the next levels to watch are at 0.6680 and 0.6630. All in all, only a breach of 0.6820 (‘strong resistance’ level previously at 0.6890) would indicate that the AUD weakness that started more than a week ago has come to an end.”",0
"EUR/USD lost more than 100 pips last week. Dollar strength is set to keep the pair heavy, economists at ING report. Like the Fed, the ECB remains very much in hawkish mode “Investors fully subscribe to the ECB's message of a 50 bps hike on 16 March and then price a further 80 bps of tightening into year-end. This should be the key difference between theFedand the ECB cycles. We think the Fed could be in a position to cut by year-end, while theECBlooks likely to keepratesat their peak throughout the majority of 2024.” “For EUR/USD, we think the strong Dollar view will dominate.

"TheGBP/USDpair defends a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on Monday and attracts some buyers in the vicinity of the monthly low. Spot prices stick to intraday gains, around the 1.1965-1.1975 region through the early part of the European session and for now, seem to have snapped a three-day losing streak. A modestUS Dollarpullback from a seven-week high turns out to be a key factor providing a lift to the GBP/USD pair. The USD downtick, meanwhile, could be attributed to some profit-taking amid a softer tone surrounding the US Treasury bond yields and a recovery in the US equity futures. Any meaningful slide for the Greenback, however, seems elusive, warranting some caution before positioning for a further appreciating move for the major. The prospects for further policy tightening by theFedshould act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and lend support to the USD. In fact, the markets seem convinced that the US central bank will stick to its hawkish stance for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The bets were reaffirmed by the stronger US PCEPrice Indexdata released on Friday, which indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. Moreover, the recent upbeat US macro data point to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow the Fed to continue raising interestrates. Investors, meanwhile, remain worried about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. This, along with geopolitical tensions, should limit losses for the safe-haven buck and keep a lid on the GBP/USD pair, at least for the time being. In the absence of any relevant data from the UK, traders look to the US economic docket - featuring the release of Durable Goods Orders and Pending Home Sales data. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, will influence the USD and provide some impetus to the GBP/USD pair. The aforementioned fundamental backdrop, meanwhile, suggests that the pair's intraday move-up could be seen as a selling opportunity. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
"Economists at TD Securities discuss theoutlookof the EUR/USD,USD/CADand USD/JPY pairs. Key support for S&P 500 aligns at 3950 “We have been biased to a tactical move lower in EUR/USD for some time. We continue to view 1.05 as the first major reassessment point for this bias, though we note that the 200-DMA will be rather crucial support. For USD/CAD, this point is 1.37 though we think this may could push higher ifstocksfail to hold key supports (we think the key level here will be 3950 in the S&P 500).” USD/JPY risks lean higher for now; 137 will be next key resistance (200-DMA) and is roughly where relative 1y1y OIS differential pit the pair. Failure to hold this resistance will likely need a break of 1.05 in EUR/USD and a push higher in terminal rate expectations (note that both broad USD variation and US/JP 1y1y OIS are solid drivers for USD/JPY).” ",1
"Sterling seems to be taking little notice of potentially improved trading and political relations between the UK and the EU. Economists at ING analyze theoutlookof the GBP against the EUR and USD. ECB looks like it has much further to hike than the BoE “An improvement in UK-EU relations probably does little for Sterling in that it will not improve the broader trading environment between the UK and the EU. Instead, the macro-monetary settings of the two will continue to dominate. The ECB looks like it has much further to hike than theBank of Englandand suggests thatEUR/GBPcontinues to find support under 0.88.” “GBP/USD will be vulnerable to continued Dollar strength and risks a move to 1.1850 this week.” ",0
"TheUSD/JPY paircorrects from a fresh YTD top touched earlier this Monday and remains on the defensive through the first half of the European session. Spot prices, however, manage to hold above the 136.00 mark and seem poised to prolong the recent upward trajectory witnessed since the beginning of this month. A softer tone surrounding the US Treasury bond yields trigger a modestUS Dollarpullback from a seven-week high, which, in turn, is seen exerting some downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. That said, a combination of factors acts as a tailwind for the major and helps limit the downside, warranting some caution before positioning for any meaningful depreciating move. The Japanese Yen (JPY) is weighed down by dovish remarks from the incoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda, stressing the need to maintain the ultra-loose policy to support the fragile economy. Ueda further added that it is possible to push up prices and wages with monetary easing. This, along with a modest recovery in the US equity futures, undermines the safe-haven JPY. Apart from this, expectations that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance should act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and lend some support to the Greenback. Meanwhile, the divergent Fed-BoJ policyoutlooksupports prospects for the emergence of some dip-buying at lower levels and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the upside. Market participants now look forward to the US economic docket, featuring the release of Durable Goods Orders and Pending Home Sales data later during the early North American session.

The pair is currently placed around the 0.6715-0.6720 region, down over 0.10% for the day, and remains at the mercy of theUS Dollarprice dynamics. A goodish recovery in the US equity futures prompts some profit-taking around the safe-haven Greenback and seems to benefit the risk-sensitive Aussie.

Temporary boost from Northern Ireland Brexit deal? “The recent modest improvement in sentiment towards the UK could be further improved in the near-term by reports that the UK is close to agreeing a deal with the EU over a post-Brexit settlement for Northern Ireland.” “While the announcement of a deal could temporarily support the Pound, it is unlikely to have a significant and lasting impact on GBP performance.

Mont-end could elicit further selling “Mont-end could elicit further selling today/tomorrow.” “The problem confronting theECB, like that facing the Fed, is that it may have to prolong the tightening cycle and by doing so cause a harder economic landing. This could bring down equities and credit markets.

A deal would be a longer-term positive for the Pound but may not alter near-term dynamics to any significant extent beyond giving the GBP a modest, psychological boost.” “Near-term trends will be driven by the broader USD tone as well as market expectations running into the Mar 23rdBoEdecision (and, to some extent, the March 15th budget announcement).” “Positive, short-term price signals around important, longer-term support levels warrant attention and sets the GBP up for more short-term gains to 1.2050.” “Key – bull trigger resistance –  lies at 1.2150.”",1

M3 growth slowed to 3.5% YoY and overall credit growth is running at 3.1% YoY, down from 6.2% this time last year.

The pair is trading near 1.0615 after hitting earlier at 1.0532, the lowest level in seven weeks. Not negative US data Economic datareleased on Monday in the US showed a larger-than-expected decline in Durable Goods Orders. The headline dropped by 4.5%, against expectations of a 4% slide. Most details of the report were positive. “The drop in January durable goods was due entirely to a reversal in aircraft orders, and core capital goods orders rose by the most in five months. The durables data thus add to a string of strong economic data for January and suggest while manufacturing activity may be set to weaken further, it's not collapsing,” said analysts at Wells Fargo.

After breaking the year’s previous high at 134.77, the USD/JPY printed another leg-up to the new YTD high at 136.55 before aiming toward the current spot price. From a technical perspective, the USD/JPY is still upward biased, backed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in bullish territory and the Rate of Change (RoC), suggesting that in the last three days, buyers have emerged. Also, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) was the last solid resistance level at 134.79, which, once conquered, exacerbated a 160 pip rally to the new YTD  high. Traders should be aware that the 20-day EMA at 133.46 crossed above the 50-day EMA at 133.36. Hence, the USD/JPY could accelerate as the 20-day EMA closes the 200-day EMA At 133.86. As the USD/JPY path of least resistance is upwards, the pair’s next ceiling level would be the 137.00 figure.

TheUS Dollar Index(DXY), which measures the US Dollar value in relation to six currencies, fell 0.52% to 104.725, reversing gains from last Friday driven by an increase in the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred inflation indicator, the Core PCE. After data on goods orders, the DXY decreased from approximately 105.100 to current quotations.

"The AUD/USD pair has sensed pressure in stretching its recovery above the immediate resistance of 0.6740 in the early Tokyo session. Therisk appetitetheme has witnessed a decent interest, however, it is not strong enough to fuel risk-sensitive assets for vertical moves. The Australian Dollar is subjected to display sheer volatility ahead as investors are awaiting the release of Australia’sGross Domestic Product(GDP) data, which will release on Wednesday. The street is anticipating a decent growth in the scale of economic activities by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of CY2022, higher than the 0.6% price in Q3. On an annualized basis, the Australian GDP is expected to display the growth of 2.7% vs. the former release of 5.9%. It seems that the restrictive monetary policy offered by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has barricaded firms from accelerating output. Apart from the Australian GDP data, monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers will be keenly watched. The monthly CPI (Jan) is seen lower at 7.9% from the former release of 8.4%. A decline in the monthly inflationary pressures will provide relief to RBAGovernor Philip Loweand other policymakers, which are worried about Australia’s sticky inflation. S&P500 showed a recovery move on Monday after a bearish week as investors shrugged off the consequences of higherratesby the Federal Reserve (Fed). The recession fears in the United States have eased dramatically amid robust consumer spending due to strong wage gains. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is likely to remain sideways as investors are shifting their focus toward the release of the United States ISM Manufacturing PMI (Feb) data, which is scheduled for Wednesday. The economic data is expected to improve to 48.0 from the former release of 47.4. A figure below 50.0 is considered a contraction in activities. Therefore, it would be worth calling it a decline in contraction. The New Orders Index that conveys forward demand is expected to rebound to 43.7 from the prior figure of 42.5. AUD/USD  ",0
"“Despite fraying relations with Beijing, US President Joe Biden is expected to forego expansive new restrictions on American investment in China, denying a push by some hawks in his administration and in Congress,” reported Politico on Monday. The news quotes five anonymous people on Capitol Hill and K Street with knowledge of the White House discussions while stating that US President Biden is scaling back a planned executive order to oversee American investments in China to focus largely on increasing transparency of those deals. Key quotes The order may still prohibit U.S. investments in at least one Chinese industry - advanced semiconductors - but will likely not block money from flowing to other parts of China’s high-tech economy. The order is now expected to largely require U.S. firms to notify federal authorities when doing deals in industries like quantum computing and artificial intelligence, though some other investment prohibitions are being debated. Though the final order is still in flux, the administration is likely to set up a pilot program under which US firms doing new deals with Chinese artificial intelligence and quantum computing firms would have to disclose details to government authorities. The debate will now turn to the Senate, where the Banking Committee will hold a hearing Tuesday on sanctions, export controls and “other tools” like outbound investment screening. AUD/USD grinds higher past 0.6700 The news offers an additional reason for the AUD/USD pair to extend the week-start rebound. However, the cautious mood ahead of Australia Retail Sales for January seems to probe the Aussie pair buyers around 0.6730 at the latest.",0
"“Central banks must remain on guard against the potential dangers of secular stagnation and low inflation as price rises driven by cost-push factors do not last long,” Bank of Japan (BoJ) Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said on Monday per Reuters. Key comments Japan's economy was in deflation for a prolonged period, but sustainable monetary easing has ‘certainly had a positive effect’ on the real economy. The mild-inflation regime has not come to an end, and we should say that the potential dangers of secular stagnation and Japanification have not yet passed. While inflation has recently accelerated across the globe, many of the factors pushing up prices are driven by higher costs such as the war in Ukraine. When an exogenous shock occurs, there is an adjustment from the old to a new price system. After adjustment, the rising inflation rate is likely to return to the steady-state inflation rate. So the important point is how this rate is affected. Of course, it is possible that cost-push factors will remain, but whether they will push up the steady-state inflation rate is uncertain. (It was) Well known that cost-push inflation does not last long. USD/JPY awaits Tokyo open Given the late Monday’s commentary from a prominentBoJofficial, the USD/JPY price should have acted positively, considering the talks in favor of the easy money policy.

"EUR/USD seesaws around 1.0600 during early Tuesday, after bouncing off a seven-week low to post the biggest daily gains over three weeks. In doing so, the major currency pair seeks fresh direction to extend the week-start rebound amid mixed catalysts and a lightcalendar. On Monday, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) snapped a four-day uptrend while reversing from the highest levels in nearly two months on mixed data, as well as a lack of major negatives for the sentiment. In doing so, while tracing the Treasury bond yields, the greenback’s gauge paid little heed to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine tensions and hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) concerns. That said, US Durable Goods Orders slumped -4.5% in January versus -4.0% expected and 5.1% prior. However, the Nondefense Capital Goods Orders ex Aircraft grew 0.8% versus 0.0% analysts’ expectations and -0.3% previous readings. Similarly, the US Pending Home Sales rallied 8.0% MoM versus 1.0% expected and 1.1% prior. At home, data published by the European Commission revealed that the Economic Sentiment Indicator in the Euro area edged lower to 99.7 in February from 99.8 in January, compared to analysts' estimate of 101. The US data triggered the much-needed pullback in the US Treasury bond yields as the benchmark 10-year coupon dropped three basis points (bps) to 3.92% after a five-week uptrend while the two-year counterpart followed suit by retreating from a three-month high to 4.78%. It’s worth noting that US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” China’s stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine puts it in an “awkward” position internationally, and any weapons support to Russia would come with “real costs.” On Monday, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson said getting back to 2% inflation is important to allow those sustained economic gains. Reuters also portrayed hawkish Fed concerns while saying, “Economic data this month reflected still tight jobs markets and inflation remaining sticky, leading Fed funds futures traders to bet on higherrates, which in the US are now seen peaking in September at 5.4%, up from 4.58% now.” Amid these plays, Wall Street closed on the positive side but failed to post major gains amid month-end moves. The latest headlines suggesting the easing stance of the US towards China seem to have helped the S&P 500 Futures to track Wall Street benchmarks. Moving on, US Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence, Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Index and RichmondFedManufacturing Index for February, and the preliminary US trade numbers for January will be important for immediate directions. Technical analysis A clear rebound from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), around 1.0530, followed by a successful break of the two-week-old descending trend line, now immediate support near 1.0585, keeps EUR/USD buyers hopeful.

"GBP/USDis flat in Asia as markets consolidate the opening range and US ""Dollar softness that kicked in at the start of the week. At the time of writing, GBP/USD is trading at 1.2065 and has stuck to a 1.2042/67 range so far. Sterling is up from a 7-week low due to not onlyUS Dollarweakness but also following British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak signing a new trade deal with the European Union. The Northern Ireland Protocol has been a factor playing into the Pound's trajectory in the forex space in recent days while a new agreement, known as the Windsor Framework, has been drawn out between the two sides. The agreement is designed to safeguard trade flows within the UK, protecting Northern Ireland’s place within the UK. However, as the Guardian writes, ''the prime minister is obviously not out of the woods. Once the detail emerges, there could be ministerial resignations.'' ''Mr Sunaksays'parliament will have a vote at the appropriate time and that vote will be respected'. This gives him the advantage of timing over his would-be opponents who might otherwise find a way to engineer a vote at a moment of maximum danger and force the government to win with Labour support, which would damage, perhaps fatally, Mr Sunak.'' Meanwhile, theBank of Englandis seen increasing Bank Rate by a further 25 bps to 4.25% in March. ''We think the BoE will be comfortable pivoting to a 25bps hike in March, followed by a pause in May,'' analysts at Standard Chartered argued. They suggest that they will do so but two factors are key: ''(1) just how generous pay rewards are for public-sector unions, and (2) whether government efforts to reduce economic inactivity – to be outlined in the budget on 14 March – are successful. The former could potentially send an unwanted inflationary signal to the private sector, while the latter could help provide some additional slack to the labour market and also help work through lingering labour supply shortages owing to COVID andBrexit,'' the analysts explained.

"AUD/USD bulls cheer strong Australia Retail Sales to extend the week-start recovery towards 0.6750 during early Tuesday. In doing so, the Aussie pair also cheers risk-on mood, as well as softer US Treasury bond yields and mixed data. That said, Australia’s seasonally adjusted Retail Sales rose 1.9% MoM versus 1.5% market forecasts and -3.9% previous readings, which allowed the Aussie pair to refresh intraday high near 0.6750. Apart from the upbeat Aussie data, a trade-positive headline from the White House also seems to underpin the AUD/USD pair’s recovery, mainly due to the pair’s risk-barometer status. That said, the US offers an olive branch to China companies despite its political differences with the dragon nation, allowing the S&P 500 Futures to track Wall Street’s gains by the press time. “Despite fraying relations with Beijing, US President Joe Biden is expected to forego expansive new restrictions on American investment in China, denying a push by some hawks in his administration and Congress,” reported Politico late Monday. Even so, the geopolitical woes and the hawkishFedtalks, not to forget the looming concerns surrounding the Australian recession, seem to keep the AUD/USD sellers hopeful. It’s worth noting that piece from Bloomberg cited the risks of Australian recession by saying, “Reserve Bank of Australia chief Philip Lowe’s expectation of further interest-rate rises ahead has prompted economists and money markets to narrow the odds of a recession in the $1.5 trillion economy.” On the other hand, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson said on Monday that it is important to get back to 2% inflation to allow those sorts of sustained economic gains. Reuters also portrayed hawkish Fed concerns while saying, “Economic data this month reflected still tight jobs markets and inflation remaining sticky, leading Fed funds futures traders to bet on higherrates, which in the US are now seen peaking in September at 5.4%, up from 4.58% now.” It should be noted that mixed US data joined the month-end consolidation to help the AUD/USD pair recover from the previous monthly low on Monday.

It’s worth noting that the sluggish MACD and RSI conditions challenge the Cable pair buyers after the quote rose the most on a daily since early January. That said, the GBP/USD remains on the way to posting the first monthly loss in five. On a different page, optimism surrounding UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s Brexit deal keeps the GBP/USD buyers hopeful as most of the hard Brexiteers have so far praised the initial deal for the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP) that needs UK Parliamentary approval.

"The AUD/USD pair is struggling to stretch its recovery above the 0.6750 resistance in the Asian session. A recovery move in the Aussie asset from the round-level support of 0.6700 lacks strength as the risk-off mood has not disappeared yet. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has attempted a recovery after building a cushion around 104.30. However, a sideways performance is widely anticipated after a vertical downside move and ahead of the release of the United States ISM Manufacturing PMI data. S&P500 futures have added more gains after registering a modest recovery on Monday. The 10-year US Treasury yields are struggling to sustain gains above 3.92%. The Australian Dollar has failed to find significant bids despite the release of the upbeat monthly Retail Sales (Jan) data. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the monthlyeconomic dataat 1.9%, higher than the consensus of 1.5%. In December, Retail Sales contracted by 3.9%. AUD/USD has formed a Hammer candlestick pattern near the crucial support plotted from December 29 low at 0.6710. The formation of Hammercandlestickindicates an emergence of responsive buyers as they consider the asset a ‘value buy’ now after a sheer downside. It is worth noting that the asset has diverged extremely from the five-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6768. Extremely shorter-term EMAs usually remain sticky with each other. A case of divergence results in a reversion of prices towards the EMA. Therefore, a pullback move cannot be ruled out. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has slipped into the bearish range of 20.00-40.00, which favors a downside momentum. Should the Aussie asset break below Monday’s low around 0.6700, US Dollar bulls will drag the asset towards December 7 low at 0.6668 followed by December 20 low at 0.6629. On the contrary, a break above February 23 high at 0.6842 will drive the asset toward February 21 high at 0.6920. A break above the latter will expose the major for more upside towards the psychological resistance at 0.7000. AUD/USD daily chart  AUD/USD  ",0

UK PM Sunak hailed framework that delivers ‘decisive breakthrough’ on trade in Northern Ireland (NI), per The Telegraph. However, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said he and his colleagues will take their time to examine the new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, reported the BBC. Also challenging optimism surrounding the NI Protocol norms are the reports shared by the Daily Express saying, “Boris Johnson has privately urged the DUP to be cautious about backing Rishi Sunak's Brexit deal.” On the other hand, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) prints mild gains around 104.80, following a downbeat start of the week, as greenback bulls cheer hawkishFedbets despite mixed US data amid an unimpressive day so far. Adding strength to the US Dollar’s rebound could be the recent pick-up in yields. Talking about the risk catalysts,market sentimentimproves on headlines suggesting the fact that the US offers an olive branch to Chinese companies despite its political differences with the dragon nation. “Despite fraying relations with Beijing, US President Joe Biden is expected to forego expansive new restrictions on American investment in China, denying a push by some hawks in his administration and Congress,” reported Politico late Monday. Alternatively, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s comments on China suggest that the political tussle among the world’s top two economies stays on the table. “China’s stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine puts it in an “awkward” position internationally and any weapons support to Russia would come with ‘real costs,’” said US Security Adviser Sullivan on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Monday. It should be noted that theBank of England(BoE) policymakers stay on the same ground as their Federal Reserve (Fed) counterparts and put a floor under the GBP/USD price. While portraying the mood, , the S&P 500 Futures print mild gains around 3,995, extending the week-start rebound from the monthly low, whereas the US two-year Treasury yields remain sidelined near 4.79% after reversing from a three-month high on Monday. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond coupons seek clear directions near 3.92% following a downbeat start of the week.

Resilience in US consumer spending pushes Fed’s rate projections near 6% Right from the labor market data to households' spending, the majority of theeconomic indicatorshave confirmed resilience in the retail demand in the United States economy. To soften the red-hot inflation, Federal Reserve (Fed) chairJerome Powellhas already pushedratesto 4.50-4.75%. Considering the recent spark in the inflationary pressures, it won’t be early mentioning the current monetary policy as incompetent to decelerate the stubborn inflation. Therefore, the street is expecting a higher terminal rate projection than the current estimates of 5.3%. Analysts at Bank of America (BofA) expect Fed chair Jerome Powell to announce three more rate hikes this year considering the resilience in the demand-driven inflation. The BofA sees the terminal rate above 6%. The investment banking firm expects a recession if a higher terminal rate projection materializes. US Manufacturing PMI is in focus for further action This week, the mega event will be the US ISM Manufacturing PMI data. Manufacturing activities in the US economy have been contracting for the past three months. Again, a dry spell is expected as firms have paused their expansion plans to avoid higher interest obligations. The economic data is expected to improve to 48.0 from the former release of 47.4. A figure below 50.0 is considered as a contraction in activities. It would be appropriate considering it a decline in the contraction streak. The New Orders Index that conveys forward demand is expected to rebound to 43.7 from the prior figure of 42.5. Economic Confidence fails to grab the 100.00 figure It was the sixth time on Monday whenEurozoneEconomic Confidence failed to garb the figure of 100.00. The street expected the sentiment data at 101.00, however, it even failed to surpass the prior figure of 99.8. The rising cost of living pressures has dented the confidence of households in the economy.

EUR/USD technical outlook  EUR/USD has sensed immense selling pressure after a pullback move to near the downward-sloping trendline plotted from February 14 high at 1.0805 on an hourly scale. This indicates that the market participants are following a ‘sell on rise’ strategy while dealing with EUR/USD. The shared currency pair has failed to sustain above the 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.0660.

"USD/JPY seesaws near 136.30-40 during the initial hours of Tuesday’s European session. In doing so, the Yen pair fails to extend the previous day’s U-turn from the two-month high while staying inside a three-week-old rising wedge bearishchartpattern. In addition to the rising wedge and lackluster moves, the impending bear cross on the MACD also keeps USD/JPY sellers hopeful unless the quote defies the bearish chart pattern. For that, the Yen pair needs to remain successfully beyond the 136.90 immediate hurdle, as well as cross the 137.00 round figure. It’s worth observing that the mid-December 2022 high near 138.20 acts as the last defense of the USD/JPY bears, a break of which could quickly propel the prices towards the 140.00 psychological magnet. Meanwhile, a convergence of the 50-SMA and the aforementioned wedge’s bottom line highlights the 135.00 round figure as the short-term key support. Should the USD/JPY bears keep the reins below the 135.00 support confluence, the early month high near 133.00 may probe sellers during the theoretical south run targeting the monthly low of near 128.00. Overall, USD/JPY bulls seem to run out of steam after posting the biggest monthly jump in four months. Though, bears are far from entry unless the quote stays beyond 135.00.

The prospects for further policy tightening by theFedremain supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and continue to act as a tailwind for the USD. In fact, the markets seem convinced that the US central bank will stick to its hawkish stance for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The bets were reaffirmed by the stronger US PCEPrice Indexreleased last Friday, which indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. Market participants, meanwhile, remain worried about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Apart from this, geopolitical tensions keep a lid on the overnight optimistic move in the equity markets, which further benefits the safe-haven Greenback and contributes to capping the upside for the risk-sensitiveAussie. This overshadows better-than-expected Australian Retail Sales data and does little to lend any support to the AUD/USD pair. In fact, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Retail Sales grew by 1.9% in January against consensus estimates for a 1.5% rise and the 3.9% downfall recorded in the previous month. The AUD/USD pair's inability to gain any meaningful traction in reaction to the upbeat domestic data suggests that the downtrend witnessed since the beginning of this month is still far from being over. Bears, however, might wait for a sustained break below the 0.6700 mark. Traders now look to the US economic docket - featuring the release of regional manufacturing PMI and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, might influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair later during the early North American session. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the downside. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",1
"UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang suggestEUR/USDrisks extra decline while below the 1.0625 level for the time being. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we held the view that EUR could dip to 1.0520 before stabilizing. EUR subsequently dipped to 1.0531 before staging surprisingly robust rebound (high has been 1. a 0619). The rebound could extend but a sustained rise above 1.0625 is unlikely (next resistance is at 1.0670). Support is at 1.0580, followed by 1.0550.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have held a negative EUR view for more than a week. Yesterday (27 Feb 2023, spot at 1.0555), we highlighted that EUR is likely to continue to weaken to 1.0485 as long as it stays below 1.0625. We did not anticipate the to a high of 1.0619 in NY trade. Downward mo strong rebound mentum is waning rapidly. A breach of 1.0625 would suggest that the EUR weakness has ended and it has moved into a consolidation phase.”",0
"The focus is on the inflation data in theEurozone. An upside surprise on the core inflation rate could lift the Euro, economists at Commerzbank report. EUR/USD levels should be limited at present “Whereas the headline rate is likely to have fallen in February, core inflation is likely to have remained stubborn. The ECB had underlined repeatedly that it is keeping a particular eye on the development of core inflation as the underlying price rises are relevant for the ECB.” “A surprise on the upside might further fuel the rate hike expectations for theECBand following yesterday’s appreciation against USD, the Euro might receive further appreciation momentum.” “For the time being, however, the USD side should be able to stand its ground so that scope for higher EUR/USD levels should be limited at present.

"EUR/USD trades in negative territory slightly below 1.0600. The pair could challenge the 1.0500 level, analysts at ING report. Hawkish expectations for ECB tightening to support EUR “Markets are currently pricing in around 130-140 bps of tightening before reaching the peak. This could offer some floor to the Euro.” “We expect any re-strengthening of the Dollar to see high-beta commodity currencies more at risk than the Euro for the time being. Still, the risks of 1.0500 being tested in the near term remain elevated.” ",1

"The USD/JPY pair catches fresh bids following the previous day's brief pause and climbs to a fresh YTD top during the first half of the European session on Tuesday. The pair is currently placed around the 136.65-136.70 area and seems poised to prolong its upward trajectory witnessed since the beginning of this month. A fresh leg up in the US Treasury bond yields, bolstered by hawkish Fed expectations, helps revive theUS Dollardemand, which, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. The markets seem convinced that the US central bank will continue to tighten its monetary policy to bring inflation down back to the 2% target. The bets were reaffirmed by the stronger US PCE Price Index last week, which indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. This remains supportive of elevated US bond yields and lends some support to the Greenback. The Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, is weighed down by the overnight dovish remarks from the incoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda. Addressing the upper house of the parliament, Ueda said that the benefits of the BoJ's stimulus outweigh its side effects. He also stressed the need to maintain the ultra-loose policy to support the fragile economy and reinforced that the BoJ isn't seeking a quick move away from a decade of massive easing. This, in turn, is seen as another factor that provides an additional lift to the USD/JPY pair. That said, a generally softer risk tone benefits the JPY's relative safe-haven status and keeps a lid on any further gains for the major, at least for the time being. Themarket sentimentremains fragile amid worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs and geopolitical tensions. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for theUSD/JPY pairis to the upside. Bulls, however, might wait for some follow-through buying beyond the 137.00 mark before placing fresh bets and positioning for further gains. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1
"EU and UK strikeBrexitdeal on Northern Ireland. Positive momentum for Sterling is likely to be short-lived, economists at Commerzbank report. Northern Ireland protocol to have little influence on inflation developments “An agreement in the row about the Northern Ireland protocol has been reached between the United Kingdom and the EU. The positive momentum for Sterling is likely to remain limited though.” “An agreement in connection with the Northern Ireland protocol is likely to have little influence on short-term inflation developments and as a result the market is likely to return its attention to data publications and comments by BoE members again pretty quickly. In this context, we remain sceptical for Sterling.” “TheBoEremains hesitant as far as further monetary policy tightening is concerned and signalled recently that it would soon reach the end of the rate hike cycle. As long as it sticks to that view, while the data publications do not signal an improvement on the inflation front Sterling is likely to remain under depreciation pressure.” ",0
"The GBP/USD pair reverses an intraday dip to the 1.2025 area and turns positive for the second straight day on Tuesday. The momentum lifts spot prices to a four-day high during the first half of the European session, with bulls now awaiting a sustained move beyond the 1.2100 round-figure mark. TheBritish Poundcontinues to draw support from optimism over the confirmation of a final deal on the Northern Ireland protocol between the UK and EU. Apart from this, rising bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE), along with the emergence of someUS Dollarselling, lend support to the GBP/USD pair. The upside, however, remains capped amid reports that the former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leaders to be cautious and think hard before backing the ""Windsor framework"". Furthermore, a combination of factors should act as a tailwind for the buck and further contribute to keeping a lid on GBP/USD pair, at least for now. Expectations that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance for longer to tame stubbornly high inflation triggers a fresh leg up in the US Treasury bond yields. Moreover, a weaker risk tone - amid looming recession risks and geopolitical tensions - could lend support to the safe-haven Greenback. This, in turn, warrants some caution before placing aggressive bullish bets around the major. Market participants now look forward to speeches by BoE officials - Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe, Chief Economist Huw Pill and Monetary Policy Committee member Catherine Mann. Later during the early North American session, traders will take cues from theUS economic docket, featuring the release of Regional Manufacturing PMIs and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.

"The single currency extends the auspicious start of the week and liftsEUR/USDto the 1.0620 region, or 3-session tops, on turnaround Tuesday. EUR/USD picks up pace on higher CPIs EUR/USDadvances for the second session in a row and looks to extend the recent breakout of the key 1.0600 barrier amidst the generalized flattish performance of the global markets on Tuesday. Some extra support for the single currency also comes after advanced inflation figures in both France and Spain surprised to the upside for the month of February, suggesting that the battle to tame inflation in the euro area could extend further than initially estimated. Earlier in the session Import Prices in Germany contracted at a monthly 1.2% in January and rose 6.6% over the last twelve months. In the US, all the attention will be on the release of the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence gauge seconded by the FHFA’s House Price Index, preliminary trade balance results and manufacturing gauges tracked by the Chicago Fed and the Dallas Fed. What to look for around EUR Price action around EUR/USD remains somewhat flat in line with the rest of the global markets, although the pair manages well to reclaim the area beyond 1.0600 the figure so far on Tuesday. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB. Key events in the euro area this week: France Flash Inflation Rate (Tuesday) – Germany/EMU FinalManufacturing PMI, Germany Unemployment Change, Flash Inflation Rate (Wednesday) – EMU Flash Inflation Rate, Unemployment Rate, ECB Accounts (Thursday) – Germany Balance of Trade, Final Services PMI, EMU Final Services PMI (Friday).

"The Swiss Franc eased a little against EUR over the past few days. Economists at Commerzbank believe that the EUR/CHF pair could extend its advance, but the Swiss National Bank is set to avoid a substantial depreciation of the CHF. SNB likely to keep a close eye on Franc exchange rate “As we assume that the price data, and in particular core inflation, from theEurozonedue to be publishedthis weekis unlikely to signal the all-clear regarding price pressure, further upside pressure in EUR/CHF might arise.” “TheSNBis likely to keep a close eye on Franc depreciation and – if necessary – intervene if the CHF were to depreciate too much, just as was the case last year.” “The threat of interventions and hawkish SNB communication is likely to limit depreciation pressure on the Franc for now, at least while inflation pressure in Switzerland remains elevated.” ",0
"EUR/USD is hanging in around 1.06. Economists at Société Générale expect the pair to move back higher toward 1.10 by the end of March. Yield differentials are wind in the Euro’s sails “We argued that a bit of risk aversion and wider credit spreads could take EUR/USD to 1.06 (and GBP/USD below 1.2). Both went marginally further, and we could still see some wobbles in the days ahead but yield differentials should start to matter again and I expect we’ll be climbing back towards EUR/USD 1.10 by the end of March.” “As for Sterling, everything now depends on DUP support for the Windsor Framework. Some negotiation may be required, but if support is forthcoming, we might see EUR/GBP get back below 0.86.” ",1
"AUD/USD continues its decline toward 0.6700. Further losses toward 0.6660 are on the cards, potentially to 0.6550, economists at Société Générale report. Support 0.6660, resistance 0.6800 “AUD/USD evolved within a Head and Shoulders. Confirmation of this formation has resulted in a short-term down move. The decline is expected to persist towards 0.6660 and target of the pattern near 0.6550.” “Confluence of the MA and the neckline at 0.6800/0.6870 is the first layer of resistance near term.” See –AUD/USD: Near-term outlook remains weak – UOB",0
"The GBP/USD pair catches fresh bids following an early slide to the 1.2025 area on Tuesday and builds on the previous day's solid bounce from the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The momentum pushes spot prices to a four-day high, beyond the 1.2100 mark, during the early North American session and is sponsored by a combination of factors. The latest optimism over a new deal on the Northern Ireland protocol between the UK and EU, along with rising bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE), underpin theBritish Pound. Adding to this, a generally positive tone around the equity markets weighs on the safe-havenUS Dollarand lends some support to the GBP/USD pair. That said, the prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed should act as a tailwind for the Greenback and cap the major amid looming recession risks. Moreover, neutral oscillators on the daily chart warrant some caution for aggressive bullish traders before positioning for a further appreciating move for the GBP/USD pair. Hence, any subsequent move up is more likely to confront stiff resistance and remain capped near the 50-day SMA, currently around the 1.2145 region. Some follow-through buying, however, could trigger a short-covering rally and lift spot prices beyond the 1.2200 mark, towards the recent swing high, around the 1.2265-1.2270 zone. On the flip side, the 1.2065-1.2060 area now seems to act as immediate support ahead of the 1.2025 zone (the daily low) and the 1.2000 psychological mark. Any further decline might continue to attract some buyers and remain limited near the 200-day SMA, currently pegged near the 1.1925-1.1920 region. A convincing break below the latter will complete a bearish double-top pattern formed near the 1.2445 area and drag the GBP/USD pair to the YTD low, around the 1.1840 zone touched in January.

GBP/USD surged higher and closed the day above 1.2000. Economists at Scotiabank believe that the pair could extend its rally as high as the mid-1.24s. Last week’s peak is a potential double bottom trigger “Sterling had a very positive session overall yesterday (bullish outside range to reject the 200-Day Moving Average support). Follow-through demand puts near-term focus on the mid-1.21 zone where last week’s high and the 55-DMA converge.” “Last week’s peak is a potential double bottom trigger following the GBP’s two recent tests of the 1.1925/30 area. Gains through here would target a retest of the GBP’s recent peaks in the mid-1.24s at least.” ,1
"Economists at Société Générale discuss EURoutlook. In their view, risks for the shared currency are tilted to the downside. Key support below 1.0500 at 1.0450 “EUR/USD support at 1.0450 if 1.05 gives way.” “March seasonals are bearish.” “European stocks and spreads have outperformed the US since the start of the year and a reconvergence would undermine the bullish EUR/USD view.” “Euro flash CPI for February is duethis weekand could cause more pain for bonds but also for EUR/USD if the data surprises to the upside.” ",0
"GBP/USD was making good ground on Tuesday following on from the rally that started on Monday in an agreement that was made and hailing the end of a tense dispute between Britain and the EU over Northern Ireland. New trade rules were put together that could resolve import issues and border checks in Northern Ireland and that could help to ensure Northern Ireland was not somehow treated separately from the rest of the United Kingdom. The deal has been dubbed the ""Windsor Framework"" — a change to the original Northern Ireland Protocol — attempts to solve those issues. The Pound Sterling climbed to a high of 1.2143 from 1.1925 at the start ofthis weekafter the UK's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's announcement. Also, the cost of insuring British government debt against default dropped to its lowest in three weeks, close to January's five-month lows, reflecting greater investor confidence. But analysts said that any positives for the pound from the newly minted post-Brexit rules would likely not last, given the economicoutlook. ''We remain unconvinced about the UK’s current fundamental backdrop,'' analysts at Rabobank said. ''In the absence of a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol, we expect upside flurries in GBP to be short-lived.'' Additionally, the analysts said, ''Comments around the risk of overtightening byBoEChief economist Pill supported the notion that the Bank could be close to a pause in policy.'' Markets expect UK rates to peak around 4.8% by the end of the year, up from 4.0% now. At the beginning of the month, the expected peak was just 4.0%. US Dollar bounces back to life Meanwhile, the US Dollar has been dominating markets in the US and choppy trading on Wall Street. A round of mainly weak economic data knocked it off its perch but it soon turned over and was back on track for the best monthly gain since September.  The Federal Reserve sentiment is keeping the greenback in the hands of the bulls as marked price in the notion that the central bank will have to raise interest rates more than initially expected. Despite some cooler data over the last couple of key releases, due to the prior slew of inflationary outcomes, the US rate futures have priced in a peak fed funds rate of 5.4% hitting in September. The market has all but priced out rate cuts this year. Consequently, the USDollar index, DXY, which measures the currency against a basket of major currencies, was higher by  0.18% in late morning trade on Wall Street and set for a February gain of over 2.5%, its first monthly increase since September. As for the data that was released on Tuesday, showing signs of cracks in the economy, US single-family home prices increased at their slowest pace in December since the summer of 2020 while the US Chicago PMI fell to 43.6 in February, weaker than expected, after sliding to 44.3 in January. To round it off, Consumer Confidence also lost its footing this month to 102.9, down from a revised 106 reading last month. GBP/USD  ",0

"The EUR/USD pairhas slipped below the critical support of 1.0580 in the early Asian session as fears of more rates announcement by the Federal Reserve (Fed) are mounting among the market participants. The major currency pair is expected to re-test a seven-week low around 1.0530 as skyrocketing hawkish Fed bets have forced investors to hide behind the US Dollar to dodgevolatility. S&P500 failed to hold gains added on Monday as the street expects that higher rates by the Fed will push the United States economy into a recession. No doubt, the strong labor market is propelling consumer spending at the current juncture. However, a continuation of policy tightening will break optimism among firms, and demand for labor will be trimmed significantly. The recovery move in the USDollar Index(DXY) has pushed it above 104.60 and is expected to fuel it further to recapture a seven-week high around 105.00. Meanwhile, the return on 10-year US Treasury bonds is still inside the woods around 3.93%. For further guidance, the US ISMManufacturing PMIdata will remain in limelight. As per the projections, the economic data is seen at 48.0 from the former release of 47.4. Apart from that, the New Orders Index that conveys forward demand is expected to rebound to 43.7 from the prior figure of 42.5. On theEurozonefront, investors are keeping an eye on preliminary German Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) (Feb) data. The annualized data is expected to decline to 9.0% from the prior release of 9.2%. It seems that rising interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB) are doing the job effectively. However, ECB President ChristineLagardehas confirmed the continuation of the 50 basis points (bps) rate hike culture for the March monetary policy as the current monetary policy is not restrictive enough to squeeze inflationary pressures as expected.

"AUD/USD picks up bids to refresh intraday high around 0.6730, following a pullback from 0.6757 in the last hour, as traders await the key Australian fourth-quarter (Q4)Gross Domestic Product(GDP) details. Adding strength to early Wednesday’s cautious mood are the official activity numbers from China. The Aussie pair managed to bounce off a two-month low the previous day after Australia Retail Sales marked a stellar 1.9% growth in January, versus 1.5% expected and -4.0% prior. Also keeping the AUD/USD buyers hopeful were headlines shared by Politico suggesting US President Joe Biden’s scaling back of the previous plans to restrict American investments in China. Further, mostly softer US data and month-end consolidation also strengthened the Aussie pair’s corrective bounce off the multi-day low on Tuesday. That said, the US Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence dropped for the second consecutive month to 102.9 versus 106.0 prior (revised) while US Housing Price Index drops 0.1% in December versus -0.6% market forecasts and -0.1% prior. On the same line, the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices grew 4.6% YoY during the said month compared to 6.1% market expectations and 6.8% previous readings. Furthermore, Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Index for February eased to 43.6 from 44.3 previous readings and 45.0 market consensus. Additionally, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index for the said month eased below 11.0 prior and -5.0 expected to -16. It should, however, be noted that the hawkish Fed bets remain on the table despite the recently downbeat US data and keeps exerting downside pressure on the AUD/USD price ahead of the keyAussiedata. As a result, the FEDWATCH tool highlights the market’s bets on Fed fund futures to be around 5.4% by late 2023 versus 5.1% signaled earlier by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). Amid these plays, Wall Street closed mixed and the US Treasury bond yields marked minor losses while the USDollar Index(DXY) regained upside momentum in the last hour to end February on a firmer footing, by marking the first monthly gain in five. Looking ahead, Australia’s Q4 GDP, expected 0.8% QoQ versus 0.6%, will be crucial for the AUD/USD pair before China’s NBS Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI for January, as well as Caixin Manufacturing PMI for the said month. “We expect Q4 GDP growth to come in at 1.0% q/q (3.0% y/y), suggesting the economy ended the year with quite a bit of momentum despite aggressive monetary tightening. While the partial data suggest a strong outcome for GDP, it will be the inflation and wagesindicatorsin the GDP report that will be key for policy perspective. We expect the RBA’s preferred measure of wider labor costs – non-farm average earnings per hour – to have risen a modest 0.6% q/q,” said Analysts at the ANZ Bank ahead of the data release. Technical analysis AUD/USD seesaws around the 100-DMA and an upward-sloping support line from late November 2022, highlighting the importance of the 0.6700 support.

"GBP/USD picks up bids to reverse the previous day’s pullback from the 50-DMA, around 1.2035 during the initial hours of Wednesday’s Asian session. The Cable pair rose to the highest levels in a week earlier on Tuesday before reversing from 1.2143 as optimism surrounding theBrexitdeal and the pair’s strength from softer US data faded as the key March month begins. Although UK PM Rishi Sunak has already signaled that he will move forward without the Democratic Unionist Party’s (DUP) support for Brexit deal, if they turn down his efforts, the fears of witnessing political drag on the key success weighed on the GBP/USD prices on Tuesday. “The framework is what we have agreed with the European Union”, said UK’s Sunak during the BBC interview when asked whether he would impose the new deal without the backing of Northern Ireland's DUP. Apart from Sunak’s optimism, softer US data and month-end consolidation also initially helped the Cable pair. Among the key US statistics, the US Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence dropped for the second consecutive month to 102.9 versus 106.0 prior (revised) while US Housing Price Index drops 0.1% in December versus -0.6% market forecasts and -0.1% prior. On the same line, the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices grew 4.6% YoY during the said month compared to 6.1% market expectations and 6.8% previous readings.

Additionally, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index for the said month eased below 11.0 prior and -5.0 expected to -16. It should be noted that the softer data and month-end positioning failed to weigh on the hawkish Fed bets and recalled the GBP/USD bears late Tuesday as markets prepared for crucial March month events comprising Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony and Fed meeting. Against this backdrop, Wall Street closed mixed and the US Treasury bond yields marked minor losses while the USDollar Index(DXY) regained upside momentum in the last hour to end February on a firmer footing, by marking the first monthly gain in five. Looking forward, final readings of the UKManufacturing PMIfor February will precedeBank of England(BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey’s speech to highlight today’s economic calendar for the GBP/USD pair traders. GBP/USD technical analysis GBP/USD eyes another attempt to cross the 50-DMA hurdle during early Wednesday in Asia, following multiple failures to overcome the same since mid-February. The Cable pair’s recovery moves take clues from the hidden bullish divergence of the RSI (14), as well as the quote’s refrain from breaking the 1.1920-25 support confluence, including the 200-DMA and ascending support line from November 21, 2022. Adding strength to the upside bias is the impending bull cross on the MACD. That said, the GBP/USD pair’s high low of the prices and lower high of the RSI (14) line is considered a hidden bullish divergence of the oscillator and suggests the quote’s gradual run-up. A downward-sloping resistance line from February 02, close to 1.2080 at the latest, can be considered as an immediate hurdle during the anticipated rise of the Cable pair ahead of battling with the 50-DMA level, near 1.2145 by the press time. Following that, the two-week high of around 1.2270 could probe the GBP/USD bulls before directing them to the multiple tops marked around 1.2445-50. Meanwhile, a convergence of the 200-DMA and a multi-day-old ascending trend line, around 1.1925-20, appears the key support to watch for the Cable pair sellers to retake control.

"TheUSD/JPY pairhas extended its recovery above 136.26 in the Asian session. The responsive buying action in the asset from 135.80 looks so confident amid weakness in the Japanese Yen as Bank of Japan (BoJ) policymakers are considering the current expansionary monetary policy as appropriate to maintain the 2% inflation confidently. National Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Japan has reached to multi-decade high near 4.2%. However, the major contributor to the elevated inflation is the higher import prices, not the strong wage gains and any resilience in the domestic demand. Therefore, the BoJ policymakers are advocating more stimulus in the economy so that the pre-pandemic growth levels could be achievable. After dovish commentary from BoJ Governor Nominee Kazuo Ueda, BoJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino favored the sustenance of easy monetary policy to spurt the overall demand in the Japanese economy. However, he assured that a time will come when an exit from the ultra-loose monetary policy will be optimal. Meanwhile, the risk profile is also not supporting the risk-sensitive assets as more rate hikes are highly expected from the Federal Reserve to strengthen its competence against the stick United States inflation. S&P500 futures have extended their losses after a bearish Tuesday, portraying a further decline in therisk appetiteof the market participants. The USDollar Index(DXY) is gathering strength to stretch its upside momentum above 104.60 ahead.

"EUR/USD slid on Tuesday to a low of 1.0573 but that was not the whole story. Earlier in the day, the Euro found bids on the back of higher-than-expected French inflation data, which sent short-dated euro zone yields to their highest in at least a decade. Then, at the start of the US day, the pair rallied to 1.0645 when US data showed signs that the Fed's rate hikes were beginning to have their intended effect and in contrast to a slew of prior inflationary outcomes. ''Base effects from last year’s Russian invasion of Ukraine should start to bring annual inflation down from March, but theECBwill be primarily concerned with sequential monthly inflation increases,'' analysts at ANZ Bank said. ''German and euro area inflation data will be released in coming days and will provide a more complete inflation backdrop for the March Governing Council meeting.'' Meanwhile, theUS Dollarwas weighed when US Consumer Confidence unexpectedly fell in February, dropping to 102.9 from a 106 reading in January, well below the forecasted 108.5. On top of that, the S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller national home price index rose just 5.8% year-on-year but dropped 0.5% in December while the Chicago PMI business survey for February also came in weaker-than-expected. Looking ahead, the USNonfarm Payrollsemployment data for February on March 10 and then the Consumer Price Index on March 14 will be key drivers in terms of the expectations over the Fed's interest rate policy. Meanwhile, for the immediate future, ISMmanufacturing PMIshould continue reflecting the fragility of the sector in February (market f/c: 45.5) while the final estimate to the S&P Global manufacturing PMI will likely confirm this too, analysts at Westpac said. ''Meanwhile, construction spending is expected to remain subdued in January given softening demand (market f/c: 0.2%). Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari is also due to speak.''

" Australia's data dump, including Gross Domestic Product and the monthly Consumer Price Index have been released and have crushed AUD/USD by around 20 pips on the miss of expectations. AUD/USD update As a result, AUD/USD dropped as follows:  AUD/USD has now broken a trendline support, invalidating the thesis for a stronger correction in the meantime, resisted by the 50% mean reversion of the prior bearish impulse:  The data would be expected to continue to weigh on the Aussie as aggressive monetary tightening is likely cooling the economy and therefore cast a move dovish sentiment over the Reserve Bank of Australia. About the Gross Domestic Product TheGross Domestic Productreleased by theAustralian Bureau of Statisticsis a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced by Australia. The GDP is considered as a broad measure of the economic activity and health. A rising trend has a positive effect on the AUD, while a falling trend is seen as negative (or bearish) for the AUD. About the monthly Consumer Price Index The monthly Consumer Price Index (YoY), released by theRBAand republished by theAustralian Bureau of Statistics, is a measure of price movements by the comparison between the retail prices of a representative shopping basket of goods and services. The purchasing power of AUD is dragged down by inflation. The CPI is a key indicator to measure inflation and changes in purchasing trends. A high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) for the AUD, while a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish).Note:This indicator started to be published in 2022 and it updates the price change for the last 12 months in Australia in a monthly basis, instead of the quarterly period of the main Australian CPI.",0
"The AUD/USD pair has slipped sharply to near 0.6700 as the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported mixedGross Domestic Product(GDP) (Q4) data. The GDP data has landed at 0.5% in Q4, lower than the consensus of 0.8% and Q3 figure of 0.6%. On an annualized basis, the GDP has remained in line with expectations at 2.7%. The monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) (Jan) has dropped significantly to 7.4% from the expectations of 8.0% and the prior release of 8.4%. A mammoth decline in the inflation data is going to provide a big relief to Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policymakers. RBAGovernor Philip Lowemight continue its policy-tightening spell as the road to price stability is far from over. A recent survey from Bloomberg claims that the Australian economy will fall into a recession while the United States economy is expected to dodge the recession situation. It is extremely difficult to predict a terminal rate for a central bank whose economy has not shown any evidence of inflation softening yet. Therefore, the chances of an Australian recession are extremely higher as the roadmap for achieving price stability in the Australian economy is full of struggles. Going forward, the release of the Caixin Manufacturing PMI data will keep the Australian Dollar volatile. According to the consensus, IHS Markit will report an improvement in the Caixin Manufacturing PMI at 50.2, higher than the prior release of 49.2. The Chinese economy is on the path of a quick recovery after the rollback of lockdown curbs, therefore, a decent performance is anticipated by the market participants. It is worth noting that Australia is the leading trading partner of China and upbeat PMI figures will strengthen the Australian Dollar ahead. Meanwhile, the risk aversion theme is getting strengthened further amid bearish cues from the S&P500 futures. The 500-US stocks basket futures have ramped up their losses in the Asian session after a weak Tuesday as fears of more rates by the Federal Reserve (Fed) are deepening worries of a slowdown ahead.  The USDollar Index(DXY) has sensed a minor loss in the upside momentum near 104.60, however, the upside bias has not been ruled out yet.

"China's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and the official Non-manufacturing PMIs have been released as follows: AUD/USD update AUD/USD has been trying to correct but the data has done little to help dig the bulls out of a hole despite sizeable beats so far. However, it is early days since the release and the bulls could find a lifeline there.  Earlier, Australia's data dump, including Gross Domestic Product and the monthly Consumer Price Index weighed on theAussieas follows:  Consequently, AUD/USD has now broken a trendline support and was resisted by the 50% mean reversion of the prior bearish impulse on Tuesday:  Despite the positive upturn in data from China PMIs, the combination of today's Chinese and Australian data would be expected to continue to weigh on the Aussie as aggressive Australian monetary tightening is likely cooling the Australian economy. This could cast a more dovish sentiment over the Reserve Bank of Australia. About the China PMIs The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) released by theChina Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP)studies business conditions in the Chinese manufacturing sector. Any reading above 50 signals expansion, while a reading under 50 shows contraction. As the Chinese economy has influence on the global economy, this economic indicator would have an impact on theForex market. The official non-manufacturing PMI, released byChina Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP), is based on a survey of about 1,200 companies covering 27 industries including construction, transport and telecommunications. It's the level of a diffusion index based on surveyed purchasing managers in the services industry and if it's above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.",1
"GBP/USD holds lower ground near the intraday bottom surrounding 1.2010, picking up bids of late, as bears keep the reins during early Wednesday. In doing so, the Cable pair justifies the previous day’s pullback from an important resistance, as well as the looming bear cross on the MACD. While the failure to cross the 1.2110 hurdle, comprising 200-Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a one-month-old downward-sloping resistance line, keeps the GBP/USD bears hopeful, a clear break of the 1.2100 threshold becomes necessary for the seller’s conviction. Following that, the “double bottom” bullish formation around 1.1920-15 will be crucial to watch as a downside break of the same won’t hesitate to drag the GBP/USD price towards January’s low near 1.1840. Alternatively, the pair’s recovery past the 1.2110 resistance confluence needs to cross a one-week-long horizontal resistance near 1.2150 to convince GBP/USD buyers. In that case, the mid-February swing high of 1.2270 appears the imminent target for the bulls ahead of aiming for the previous monthly top surrounding 1.2400. It should, however, be noted that the pair’s sustained trading beyond 1.2400 will be difficult as the multiple tops around 1.2445-50 could challenge the bulls afterward. To sum up, GBP/USD is likely to decline further but the downside room appears limited. GBP/USD: Four-hour chart  Trend: Limited downside expected Additional important levels  ",0

Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group said, “The recovery in manufacturing activity came as the most recent wave of Covid-19 infections subsided.” “Both manufacturing supply and demand expanded last month, as production gradually returned to normal while both domestic and external demand improved after a Covid policy shift,” Wang added.

"AUD/USD picks up bids to reverse early losses to around 0.6730 after China data pleased Aussie bulls, after an initial disappointment from the statistics at home, during early Wednesday. China’s Caixin Manufacturing PMI rose to 51.6 versus 50.2 expected and 49.2 for February. In doing so, the private manufacturing activity gauge traced the official numbers. Earlier in the day, China NBS Manufacturing PMI jumped to 52.6 compared to 50.5 market forecasts and 50.1 prior. More importantly, Non-Manufacturing PMI rallied to 56.3 versus analysts’ expectations of 49.7 and 54.4 previous readings. Also read:China's Caixin Manufacturing PMI expands to 51.6 in February vs. 50.2 expected It’s worth noting that the downbeat prints of Australia’s fourth-quarter (Q4)Gross Domestic Product(GDP) and Monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January earlier drowned the AUD/USD pair towards refreshing the two-month low. Talking about that,AussieQ4 GDP came in lower than expected 0.8% and 0.6% prior readings while flashing 0.5% quarterly growth. The yearly GDP growth, however, matches 2.7% market consensus, down from 5.9% prior. On the same line was the monthly CPI data for January as it dropped to 7.4% versus 8.0% expected and 8.4% prior. Elsewhere, fears of more inflation and higher rates seem to have weighed on themarket sentimentand propelled the US Treasury bond yields, while also exerting downside pressure on thestockfutures. The same joins chatters that China President Xi Jinping is up for a big overhaul of Chinese government agencies and a likely increase in the US-China tension, signaled by Bloomberg. To sum up, AUD/USD cheers upbeat data from the key customer to lure buyers but the upside bias remains absent amid the hawkish Fed concerns and inflation fears.

"EUR/USD picks up bids to refresh intraday high around 1.0580-85 as it prints mild gains to consolidate the biggest monthly slump fall in five during early Wednesday. In doing so, the Euro pair seems to brace for the first readings of Germany’s key inflation number for February, namely the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), expected 0.7% MoM versus 0.5% prior. That said, the quote’s multiple failures to cross the 50-bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA) join the receding bullish bias of the MACD signals to favor sellers. Even if the EUR/USD price crosses the 50-EMA hurdle surrounding 1.0620, a downward-sloping resistance line from mid-February and 200-EMA, close to 1.0640 and 1.0695 in that order, could challenge the pair buyers. It’s worth observing that multiple levels marked since January 09 highlight the 1.0765-70 horizontal area as the last defense of the EUR/USD bears. Meanwhile, a two-month-old ascending support line, near 1.0545, could restrict the short-term downside ofthe EUR/USD pair. Following that, lows marked during the last month and January, around 1.0530 and 1.0480 in that order, could lure the EUR/USD bears.

"USD/JPY prints mild gains around 136.30-40 during early Wednesday morning in Europe. In doing so, the Yen pair snaps the previous two-day losing streak around the lowest levels since late December 2022. The recovery moves, however, gain little acceptance amid overbought RSI (14), as well as due to the presence of the key 100-DMA and 200-DMA. Hence, the quote’s latest rebound needs validation from the 100-DMA and 200-DMA, respectively near 136.85 and 137.20, to convince buyers. Adding to the upside filter is the last December’s peak near 138.20. Following that, the 140.00 round figure and late November 2022 high of 142.25 could lure the USD/JPY buyers. On the flip side, a 13-day-long ascending support line, close to 135.35 at the latest, restricts the short-term pullback of theUSD/JPY pair. In a case where the USD/JPY price drops below the 135.35 support, the January 2022 peak near 134.75 can act as the additional check for the pair bears before aiming for the multiple support levels surrounding 131.00. Overall, USD/JPY may trace bullish MACD signals to extend the run-up beyond the nearby support line but the room towards the north appears limited due to the existence of the key moving averages and overbought RSI conditions.

"The GBP/USD pair is displaying a sideways auction after sustaining above 1.2020 in the early European session. The Pound Sterling is expected to remain sideways as investors are awaiting the release of the speech fromBank of England(BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey, which is scheduled for Wednesday. The Cable is expected to stretch its recovery above 1.2040 vertically as the USDollar Index(DXY) is expected to extend its losses amid a recovery in the risk-on market mood. The USD Index is struggling to find feet as the release of the upbeat CaixinManufacturing PMIdata has ameliorated the negativemarket sentiment. S&P500 futures have recovered their entire losses generated in the Asian session now, portraying a sheer improvement in therisk appetiteof the market participants. However, the 10-year US Treasury yields look still solid above 3.93%. Going forward, the speech from BoE Governor Andrew Bailey will be of utmost importance. BoE Bailey is expected to provide cues about the likely monetary policy action ahead. A hawkish tone is expected from BoE Governor as the United Kingdom (UK) inflation is still in the double-digit figure despite a prolonged spree of rate hikes. Meanwhile, the street seems not confident about the Pound Sterlingoutlookdespite theBrexitdeal. Economists at Commerzbank are of the view that “An agreement in connection with the Northern Ireland protocol is likely to have little influence on short-term inflation developments and as a result, the market is likely to return its attention to data publications and comments by BoE members again pretty quickly. In this context, we remain skeptical of Sterling.” GBP/USD  ",1
"EUR/USD picks up bids to refresh intraday high near 1.0595 heading into Wednesday’s European session. That said, the major currency pair marked the biggest monthly loss since the last September before marking the latest corrective bounce. In doing so, the Euro pair takes clues from the broad US Dollar pullback amid a month-start sluggish session and pre-data anxiety. It’s worth noting that the upbeat prints of inflation numbers from Spain and France join China-inspired favor to the risk-on mood to also underpin the EUR/USD rebound. That said, the preliminary readings of Spanish and French Consumer Price Index (CPI) details for February marked upbeat outcomes and bolstered the hawkish concerns surrounding the European Central Bank’s (ECB) next move on Tuesday. On the contrary, the US Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence dropped for the second consecutive month to 102.9 versus 106.0 prior (revised) while US Housing Price Index drops 0.1% in December versus -0.6% market forecasts and -0.1% prior. Furthermore, Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Index for February eased to 43.6 from 44.3 previous readings and 45.0 market consensus whereas the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index for the said month eased below 11.0 prior and -5.0 expected to -16. It should be noted that strong prints of China’s Caixin and NBS Manufacturing PMIs for February joins the Non-Manufacturing PMI for the said month to mark an upbeat economic rebound in the world’s biggest industrial player and favored the risk profile. Even so, China Finance Minister Liu He said after the data release that the foundation of China's economic recovery is still not stable. Against this backdrop, S&P 500 Futures turn positive after initially tracking Wall Street’s mild losses. However, the firmer US Treasury bond yields and hawkish Fed bets, as well as the global inflation woes, keep the US Dollar on the bull’s radar. That said, the USDollar Index(DXY) clings to mild losses near 104.85 after February’s impressive north-run. Looking ahead, the first readings of Germany’s key inflation gauge for February, namely the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), could challenge the pair’s upside momentum on missing the upbeat 0.7% MoM forecasts, versus 0.5% prior. Also important to watch are the S&P Global and ISM PMI details for February.

"AUD/USD has stretched its V-shape recovery move above to near the 0.6760 resistance in the early European session. The Aussie asset witnessed a sell-off in the Asian session after the release of the downbeat AustralianGross Domestic Product(GDP) and a sheer decline in the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI). The downside bias in the Australian Dollar faded after the release of the upbeat Caixin Manufacturing PMI data, which infused fresh blood into the Aussie and resulted in a V-shape recovery. S&P500 futures have turned positive after recovering significant losses posted in the Tokyo session, portraying a sheer recovery in therisk appetitetheme. The USDollar Index(DXY) has refreshed its day low below 104.47 as investors have ignored the uncertainty associated with hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) bets. Also, the safe-haven assets are struggling to find a cushion as investors have underpinned the risk-on mood. Contrary to the positivemarket sentiment, the return offered on the 10-year US Treasury bonds looks still solid around 3.94%. RBA senses relief as Australian Inflation softens and GDP trims Investors dumped the Australian Dollar in the Asian session after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported significantly lower monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures than anticipation. The monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) (Jan) dropped significantly to 7.4% from the expectations of 8.0% and the prior release of 8.4%. A mammoth decline in the inflation data is going to provide a big relief to Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policymakers. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been making efforts in bringing down inflationary pressures by the continuation of policy tightening. Reserve Bank of AustraliaGovernor Philip Lowehas already pushed its Official Cash Rate (OCR) to 3.35% in order to tame the stubborn inflation. And, more rates must be in pipeline to achieve price stability sooner. Apart from the monthly CPI, Australian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Q4) has dropped to 0.5% from the consensus of 0.8% and Q3 figure of 0.6%. On an annualized basis, the GDP has remained in line with expectations at 2.7%. A decline in GDP numbers also showcases lower demand from households, which will trim inflation projections ahead as producers will be forced to scale down the prices of their offerings. Upbeat Caixin Manufacturing PMI strengthens the Australian Dollar It was widely anticipated that China’s manufacturing sector will outperform after the rollback of strict lockdown measures. Chinese administration and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) are dedicated to spurring economic recovery by improving domestic demand. The IHS Markit reported the Caixin Manufacturing PMI data at 51.6, higher than the expectations of 50.2 and the former release of 49.2. Apart from that, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Manufacturing PMI (Feb) landed higher at 52.6 vs. the consensus of 50.5 and the prior release of 50.1. The Services Manufacturing PMI exploded to 56.3 against 54.4 released in January while the street was anticipating a downbeat figure at 49.7. It is worth noting that Australia is the leading trading partner of China and a sharp recovery in the Chinese economy is also supportive of the Australian Dollar. ISM Manufacturing PMI- the next trigger for the US Dollar The street is awaiting the release of the United States Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI data. As per the consensus, the economic data is seen at 48.0 from the former release of 47.4. Apart from that, the New Orders Index that conveys forward demand is expected to rebound to 43.7 from the prior figure of 42.5. It is worth noting that the Manufacturing PMI is in a contraction phase consecutively for the past three months. A figure below 50.0 is considered as a contraction in the extent of activities. Federal Reserve policymakers are expected to keenly watch the PMI figures as a surprise upside could strengthen the expectations of more hikes ahead.

"The USD/JPY pair edges higher following the previous day's two-way price swings and trades with a mild positive bias through the early European session. The pair is currently placed below mid-136.00s and remains well within the striking distance of its highest level since December 20 touched on Tuesday. A combination of factors undermines the Japanese Yen (JPY), which, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair amid the underlying bullish sentiment surrounding theUS Dollar. Data released earlier this Wednesday showed that Japan's manufacturing sector remained in contraction territory in February. This comes on the back of dovish comments from the incoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda and Deputy Governor nominee Shinichi Uchida, stressing the need to maintain the ultra-loose monetary policy. This, along with signs of stability in the equity markets weigh on the safe-haven JPY. The USD, on the other hand, remains pinned near a multi-week high amid firming expectations for further policy tightening by the Fed and lends additional support to the USD/JPY pair. In fact, the markets now seem convinced that the US central bank will have to raise interest rates for longer to tame stubbornly high inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and continues to act as a tailwind for the Greenback. That said, indications that the Fed's rate hikes were beginning to have their intended effect of cooling the economy seem to cap any meaningful gains for the buck. Investors remain worried about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. The fears were fueled by Tuesday's disappointing release of the Conference Board's US Consumer Confidence Index, which fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in the previous month. Furthermore, the Chicago PMI business survey for February also came in weaker-than-expected and dropped to 43.6 in February, marking the sixth straight month in contraction territory. The Richmond Fed also released its survey of manufacturing activity for February and reported a decline to -16 from -11 in January 2023. The aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop is holding back traders from placing aggressive bets and keeping a lid on any meaningful gains for the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. Market participants now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of ISMManufacturing PMIlater during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields, will influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to theUSD/JPY pair.

"IsBank of EnglandGovernor Andrew Bailey acting as a brake for Sterling? Antje Praefcke, FX Analyst at Commerzbank, believes that the GBP could come under downside pressure again. Effects of Brexit on the UK have not disappeared “Will Bailey put a brake on Sterling’s rise? I think that is possible, depending on his comments. If the British economy were to hold up better than feared, it would be easier for the BoE to continue its rate hike cycle as it would have to take less consideration for economic developments. In addition, there is now relief about an agreement between the EU and UK on the Northern Ireland protocol.

"Further upside inUSD/JPYshould remain on the cards while above the 136.90 level according to UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Market Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we expected USD to trade within a range of 135.80/136.60. However, USD popped to a high of 136.93 and then dropped sharply to close unchanged at 136.00. Upward momentum has not improved and USD is unlikely to advance further. Today, USD is more likely to trade sideways between 135.70 and 136.90.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We highlighted on Monday (27 Feb, spot at 136.30) that after the strong rise late last week, upward momentum has been boosted and this will likely lead to further USD strength. We indicated, the next resistance level to watch is at 137.90. While USD rose to a fresh 2-week high of 136.93 yesterday, upward momentum has not improved further. USD must break and hold above 136.90 in the next 1-2 days or the chances of a move to 137.90 will rapidly diminish.”",1
"The GBP/USD pair attracts fresh buyers in the vicinity of the 1.2000 psychological mark on Wednesday and stalls the overnight rejection slide from the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The intraday positive move picks up pace during the early European session and lifts spot prices to a fresh daily high, around the 1.2085 region in the last hour. TheUS Dollarretreats from a multi-week high touched on Tuesday, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the GBP/USD pair higher. The upbeat Chinese PMI prints for February fuel optimism that a recovery in the world's second-largest economy is gaining steam and boosts investors' confidence. This is evident from signs of stability around the equity markets and weighs heavily on the safe-haven Greenback. TheBritish Pound, on the other hand, draws additional support from the new UK-EU agreement on the Northern Ireland protocol, which eliminates the risk of a potential trade war between the two sides. Adding to this, rising bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) lend some support to the GBP/USD pair. Some analysts, however, still hope that the UK central bank would pause the current tightening cycle. In contrast, the Federal Reserve is universally expected to stick to its hawkish stance for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and should act as a tailwind for the USD. Moreover, worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs should cap any optimism in the markets and contribute to limiting losses for the safe-haven buck. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before positioning for an extension of the GBP/USD pair's solid bounce from a technically significant 200-day SMA. Traders now look to the final UK Manufacturing PMI, though the focus will remain on the BoE Governor Andrew Bailey's speech. Later during the early North American session, the USISMManufacturing PMIcould influence the USD and provide some impetus. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1

"The AUD/USD pair stages a recovery from sub-0.6700 levels, or a nearly two-month low touched earlier this Wednesday and scales higher through the first half of the European session. The momentum lifts spot prices to a fresh weekly high, around the 0.6775-0.6780 region in the last hour, with bulls now eyeing to test the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) support breakpoint. The upbeat Chinese data benefits the China-proxy Australian Dollar and prompts aggressive short-covering around the AUD/USD pair amid a sharp intradayUS Dollardownfall. In fact, the official Chinese PMI prints for February indicated that business activity in the country rose to pre-COVID levels and that recovery in the world's second-largest economy is gaining steam. This largely offsets the softer-than-expected Australian macro data. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the economy expanded by 0.5% in the three months to December, lower than the 0.8% expected and 0.6% in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, fourth quarter GDP rose 2.7%, as expected, though marked a significant slowdown from the 5.9% growth recorded in the previous quarter. Another report showed that Consumer Price Index (CPI) missed market estimates and decelerated from 8.4% to 7.4% in January. The latest optimism, meanwhile, leads to a modest recovery in the global risk sentiment and weighs heavily on the safe-haven Greenback. This, in turn, is seen as another factor pushing the AUD/USD pair higher, though hawkish Fed expectations and looming recession risks could keep a lid on any further gains. The markets seem convinced that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and supports prospects for the emergence of some USD dip-buying. Furthermore, investors remain worried about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Adding to this, geopolitical tensions should cap any optimism in the markets and cap the risk-sensitiveAussie. This, in turn, warrants some caution before confirming that the pair has formed a near-term bottom. From a technical perspective, the pair formed a Japanese candlestick tweezer-bottom pattern over Monday and Tuesday, and this, followed by today's strong bullish green candle suggests a strong possibility of, at least, a short-term counter-trend rally evolving. The measured move that began at the February 2 highs and has seen the AUD/USD fall over 450 pips in the month of February appears to have completed, further suggesting bears may take a breather, allowing bulls freer reign. Market participants now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of theISMManufacturing PMIlater during the early North American session.

"TheUSD/JPY pairattracts some sellers following an intraday uptick to the 136.45 area on Wednesday and moves further away from the YTD peak touched the previous day. Spot prices slide closer to the mid-135.00s during the first half of the European session, though any meaningful corrective decline seems elusive. A sharpUS Dollarretracement slide from a multi-week high turns out to be a key factor exerting some pressure on the USD/JPY pair. The downside, however, is likely to remain limited, at least for the time being, amid the divergent Bank of Japan(BoJ)-Fed monetary policyoutlook. This, in turn, warrants some caution for aggressive bearish traders and positioning for deeper losses. In fact, the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and Deputy Governor nominee Shinichi Uchida recently stressed the need to maintain the ultra-loose monetary policy to support the fragile domestic economy. In contrast, the US central bank is universally expected to stick to its hawkish stance for longer and continue hiking interest rates in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed remain supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and favour the USD bulls. Apart from this, signs of stability in the equity markets, bolstered by the upbeat Chinese PMIs, could undermine demand for the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY). This, in turn, should lend some support to the USD/JPY pair and help limit the downside. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the USD/JPY pair's recent appreciating move witnessed over the past month or so has run out of steam. From a technical perspective the defence of the trendline drawn joining the February 2 with the February 24 lows, and underpins the current day's lows at roughly 135.30, may be critical, and as long as it holds bulls have the upper hand. A decisive break and close below this trendline on the 4-hr or daily chart, however, would forsee momentum pick up on the downside, and the probable reversal of the short-term trend from positive to negative.

"Economists at Barclays Research see scope for further upside inthe EUR/USD pair. Ongoing policy normalization by the ECB supports medium-term EUR upside “A faster exit from zero-COVID in China and a maturing tightening cycle for the Fed, given signs that US inflation is peaking, imply more upside for the EUR in 2023.” “By our estimates, there is an additional 3-4% upside potential in EUR/USD from China’s reopening alone, which however seems to be on hold given geopolitical concerns surrounding the China-Russia rapprochement.” “Upside risks to energy prices from geopolitics and China’s reopening have yet to materialize.

That would constitute a rather more positive signal for USD.” “However, as the market has already gone a long way in its expectations the upside potential in USD is likely to be limited.” “A small excursion towards the lows seen at the start of the week might be seen again.

Technically, the price moved back above its 100 hour moving average (currently at 0.67515), and tested the 38.2% retracement of the move down from last week's high. That level came in at 0.67806. The high price reached 0.6783 before rotating back to the downside. The price is back down testing the 100 hour moving average. Key level for both buyers and sellers. On a move below the 100 hour MA, traders will be eyeing the 100 day moving average at 0.6734. That is another key barometer if the sellers are to take back more control.

"Eurostat will release the preliminary estimate ofEurozoneHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for February on Thursday, March 2 at 10:00 GMT and as we get closer to the release time, here are the expectations forecast by the economists and researchers of six major banks regarding the upcoming EU inflation print. Headline is expected at 8.2% year-on-year vs. 8.6% in January while core is expected to remain steady at 5.3%. On a monthly basis, the HICP in the old continent is expected to fall by 0.3% in the reported period as against the previous decrease of 0.2%. The core HICP is likely to show no growth at 0% in February vs. -0.8% prior. Commerzbank “In the euro area, inflation continues to be strongly dominated by the development of energy and food prices. In February, energy prices fell significantly, which will probably push the inflation rate down from 8.6% to 8.1%. However, from the ECB's point of view, it is probably more significant that the core inflation rate remains at a high 5.3%. This shows that underlying inflation remains high.” TDS “Softer energy inflation likely continued to weigh on headline inflation in the EZ. That said, on MoM basis, energy inflation likely stayed resilient, in part as subsidized prices won't have declined by as much as wholesale prices. Core will be the main focus though, and another strong print will add more pressure on theECBto keep hiking in 50 bps clips after Mar.” Nomura “We expect the headline rate to be unchanged at 8.6%, but see core rising to 5.6%, which will be the highest since 1993.” SocGen “We expect the February HICP to decelerate from 8.6% to 8.2% YoY, dragged down by energy inflation but core inflation should be up 0.2pp to 5.5% YoY and will likely stay above 3.5% this year.” Citibank “Eurozone headline inflation should edge lower in the February flash HICP but only slightly, confirming the passthrough of lower gas prices takes time. However, we expect another solid MoM print on core CPI. Services inflation should edge higher while the January uptick in core goods HICP is likely to reverse only partially and probably not before March/April. Euro Area HICP, February: Citi Forecast 8.5% YoY, Prior 8.6% YoY; Core CPI, Feb: CitiForecast5.4% YoY, Prior 5.3% YoY.” Wells Fargo “All signs point to headline inflation having already peaked and now trending lower. On the other hand, it is less clear when underlying inflation will begin to recede substantially. In response to still-present inflation pressures, we do not think the ECB is finished monetary tightening quite yet. We expect the ECB to follow through on its guidance for another 50 bps rate hike in the Deposit Rate in March and expect two additional 25 bps increases in May and June, which would see a peak at 3.50% for the current cycle.” ",1
"The EUR/USD retreated after the release of theISM Manufacturing PMIthat boosted, at least momentarily, the US Dollar across the board. The pair pulled back from 1.0691, the highest level in a week to 1.0640. After finding support at the 1.0640 area, the EUR/USD is moving back toward the daily highs as Dollar’s momentum after data fades. The pair is hovering around 1.0670, slightly below the 20-day Simple Moving Average. Despite the retreat the short-term bias continues to point to the upside. USD up on data, but not for long Data released in the US showed activity in the Manufacturing sector contracted again in February with the ISM PMI rising from 47.4 to 47.7 (below 50 marks contraction), against market consensus of 48. The Price Paid Index rose from 44.5 to 51.3, surpassing expectations of a 45 reading. The inflationindicatorsof the ISM report pushed Treasury yields to the upside. The US 10-year bond yield reached 4% for the first time since November. TheUS Dollarreacted to the upside but lost impulse during the last minutes, as stocks and commodity prices rebounded. The Euro is among the top performers on Wednesday following German inflation data that came in above expectations. The figures add pressure to the European Central Bank.

"The USD/JPY remains pressured, though capped by recent US economic data, as the US ISMManufacturing PMIfor February fell short of estimates. However, some subcomponents show that again prices are rising. The USD/JPY is exchanging hands at 136.08. USD/JPY continues to consolidate after mixed US ISM Manufacturing PMI US equities are trading mixed after the release of the ISM. The reading came at 47.7, below estimates of 48 for February, meaning that factories still feel the impact of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) aggression. Delving into the report, the Prices Index rose to 51.3, past the 45.1 estimates, spurring a knee-jerk reaction in the USDollar Index(DXY), and the USD/JPY spiked to 136.31. Lately, investors have turned less optimistic about inflation in the United States (US). Money market futures are pricing the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) at around 5.25% -5.50% by June 2023, and no rate cuts throughout the year. Earlier, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for the US came shorter than the prior’s month data, at 47.3 vs. 47.8, a prelude of what was coming, later with data released by the ISM. Federal Reserve officials insist on their hawkish rhetoric led by Neil Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. He said interest rates should reach 5.4% in December and stay at that level. He also mentioned that he would consider increasing rates by either 25 or 50 basis points during the upcoming Fed meeting and added that the dangers associated with not tightening monetary policy are greater than those of tightening it too much. Contrarily, Atlanta’sFed President Raphael Bosticbelieved that rates need to go as high as 5% - 5.25% and stood there “well into 2024.” He added that the economy has the momentum to support higher rates without a major downturn. Despite the hawkishness provided by Kashkari, the USD/JPY failed to edge higher. Additionally, rising UST yields, like the 10-year benchmark note rate, approach the 4% threshold, but sentiment keeps USD/JPY traders on the sidelines, waiting for additional US economic data. USD/JPY Technical analysis The USD/JPY daily chart shows the major consolidating at around 136.00. Back-to-back doji’s in the daily time frame suggest that buyers and sellers are at equilibrium. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is almost flat but nearby overbought conditions, while the Rate of Change (RoC) indicates sellers are gathering momentum. For a bullish resumption, the USD/JPY must clear the YTD high of 136.91, so the pair might test 138.00. Otherwise, a fall below 135.25 would pave the way toward 135.00.  What to watch? ",0

Most European stock markets posted losses, and in Wall Street, indexes were mixed. The market hit bottom after the release of the US ISMManufacturing PMIbut then recovered. The February Index rose to 47.7, showing the sector remains in contraction territory. The surprise came from the Price Paid Index, which jumped 6.8 points to 51.3 and triggered a sell-off in Treasuries and a short-lived recovery of the US Dollar. Currencies reflected somewhat more optimism than equities. Chinese PMIs rose above 50, leading to hopes for the economic outlook. Market participants will continue to look closely at the bond market after a day in which US and European bond yields jumped after inflation figures.

"The EUR/USD pairhas turned sideways after failing to recapture the round-level resistance of 1.0700 in the late New York session. The major currency pair is expected to recapture the aforementioned resistance as the risk-off mood has faded after hopes of recovery in China post the release of the CaixinManufacturing PMIovershadowed the risk of a global recession. S&P500 settled Wednesday’s session with some losses after Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers sounded hawkish while delivering guidance on interest rates. The USDollar Index(DXY) has retreated to near 104.00 after failing to extend recovery above 104.20, portraying mix market mood. Meanwhile, the demand for US government bonds remained extremely weak, which led to a jump in the 10-year US Treasury yields to 4%. AtlantaFed President Raphael Bosticexpected the central bank to push the terminal rate to the 5.00%-5.25% range as the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) is extremely sticky. Apart from that, the Fed policymaker expects the central bank to keep the elevated terminal rate stable well into 2024. Meanwhile, the release of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI gamut claimed that the inflationary pressures have rebounded and the Fed should not be in a hurry to calm down the policy tightening spell. The Manufacturing PMI remained contracted consecutively for the fourth time amid higher rates by the Fed. The economic data landed at 47.7, lower than the consensus of 48.0. However, the forward demand looks extremely solid as New Orders Index jumped to 47.0 from the expectations of 43.7 and the former release of 42.5. On theEurozonefront, stronger-than-anticipated German Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) cleared that the road towards achieving price stability for the European Central Bank (ECB) is full of troubles. The German HICP climbed to 9.3% from the estimates of 9.0% and the former release of 9.2%.

In doing so, the Aussie pair struggles to justify the softerUS Dollarand China-linked market optimism amid strong US Treasury bond yields and mostly upbeat US data. That said, the Aussie pair managed to reverse theAussieGDP and inflation-induced pessimism after strong China activity data for February. The risk barometer pair also benefited from China Finance Minister Liu He’s comments as he showed readiness to bolster the nation’s fiscal spending. The policymaker also mentioned that the foundation of China's economic recovery is unstable and challenges the AUD/USD bulls afterwards. Elsewhere, US ISMManufacturing PMIdetails renew inflation fears as the headline gauge rose to 47.7 from 47.4 prior, versus the 48.0 expected. However, the Prices Paid and New Orders were the highest in five and four months respectively. Ahead of the data, Minneapolis Federal Reserve (Fed) President Neel Kashkari said, ""Wage growth is now too high to be consistent with 2% inflation."" The policymaker also added and noted that it is concerning that the Federal Reserve's rate hikes so far have not brought down service inflation. It should be observed the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels since early November 2022 by poking the 4.0% mark, whereas the two-year counterpart rallied to the June 2007 levels by piercing the 4.90% mark. The jump in the US Treasury bond yields suggests the market’s fears of inflation and recession, challenging the risk-barometer AUD/USD pair. That said, Wall Street closed mixed while the S&P 500 Futures struggled for clear directions of late. Looking forward, Australia’s Building Permits for January may offer immediate direction ahead of the US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims. However, significant attention will be on Friday’s US ISM Services PMI amid fears of strong services inflation.

S&P500 futures witnessed pressure as investors are still struggling to ignore fears of more rates from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Hawkish commentaries delivered by Fed policymakers fueled US Treasury yields. The return offered on 10-year US government bonds jumped to 4%. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari reiterated on Wednesday that inflation in the US is still very high and that their job is to bring it down, as reported by Reuters. He further added that he is open-minded on a 25 basis points (bps) hike versus a 50 bps increase. Considering the whole US ISM Manufacturing PMI (Feb) gamut, it would be appropriate to consider a rebound in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) as forward demand and prices paid by producers have skyrocketed. The ISM Manufacturing New Orders Index accelerated to 47.0 from the expectations of 43.7 and the former release of 42.5. And the Manufacturing Price Paid climbed to 51.3 vs. the consensus of 45.0 and the former release of 44.5. Higher prices paid by manufacturers will be added to the goods offered by them and will amp up the inflationary pressures. Ambiguous commentary fromBank of England(BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey has pushed the Pound Sterling inside the woods. An absence of clear guidance on interest rates kept investors on the sidelines.

It seems that the hawkish stance of Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers has infused fresh blood into the US Treasury yields. The alpha delivered on 10-year US government bonds has scaled to 4%. Considering the stubborn nature of the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI), AtlantaFed President Raphael Bosticexpected the central bank to push the terminal rate to the 5.00%-5.25% range. Apart from that, the Fed policymaker expects the central bank to keep the terminal rate elevated beyond 2023. Also, Fed chair Jerome Powell has been reiterating that a consideration of a premature rate cut could have a devastating impact on the inflation situation. The release of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI on Wednesday has cleared that the price index is expected to deliver a rebound ahead. Feb PMI numbers failed to impress the street, however, New Orders Index and Manufacturers Prices Paid managed to convey that the inflation situation is getting complex. The order book looks solid as figures jumped to 47.0 from the expectations of 43.7 and the former release of 42.5. And, the Manufacturing Price Paid climbed to 51.3 vs. the consensus of 45.0 and the former release of 44.5, which indicates thatProducer Price Index(PPI) might deliver a surprise upside ahead.

In doing so, the Yen pair prints mild gains after bouncing off the 50-bar Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a two-week-old horizontal support zone. Not only a sustained recovery from the key technical levels but the easing bearish bias of the MACD signals also favor theUSD/JPY pairbuyers. With this, the risk-barometer pair is well-set to poke an upward-sloping resistance line from early February, close to 137.30 by the press time, It’s worth noting that the weekly top surrounding 136.90 and the 137.00 round figure could act as immediate resistances for the USD/JPY bulls to watch. In a case where USD/JPY remains firmer past 137.30, the late 2022 peak surrounding 138.20 should return to the charts. On the flip side, the 50-SMA level of near 135.40 acts as an adjacent support for the Yen pair. Following that, the aforementioned two-week-long horizontal support zone puts a floor under the USD/JPY price of around 135.05-25. It should be noted that the 100-SMA level of 134.00 and the February 20 swing low of around 133.95 could act as the last defense of the USD/JPY buyers.

The 10-year US Treasury yields are constantly refreshing their three-month high as the Fed is set to push interest rates by 5% by summer. At the press time, the 10-year US Treasury yields have printed a high of 4.02%. However, the USD Index is struggling to find direction after weak US Manufacturing PMI data. On Wednesday, the US ISM reported a surprise decline in the Manufacturing PMI figures. The economic data contracted consecutively for the fourth time, landed at 47.7, lower than the consensus of 48.0 but higher than the former release of 47.4. The catalyst that is supporting yields is the Manufacturing New Orders Index data, which indicates robust forward demand and could fuel inflationary pressures. The economic data jumped strongly to 47.0 from the expectations of 43.7 and the former release of 42.5, portraying a brightoutlook. Meanwhile, a sheer decline in the monthly Australian monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to restrict the Australian Dollar to the downside. The monthly CPI (Jan) dropped significantly to 7.4% from the expectations of 8.0% and the prior release of 8.4%.

Producers might look for passing the impact of higher prices paid to the ultimate consumers, which will trigger the inflation spiral again. Therefore, the Federal Reserve (Fed) believes that halting more rates announcement would be premature at the current stage. On theEurozonefront, a rebound in the German Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) has cleared that inflation is exceptionally stubborn.

That said, USDollar Index(DXY) extends the bounce off a one-week low to 104.70 at the latest, up 0.27% intraday, as the hawkish bias of the major central bank officials joins inflation fears to propel the yields. Also adding strength to the US Dollar could be the upbeat details of the US ISMManufacturing PMIfor February. On the contrary, Germany’s Inflation number, per the Consumer Price Index (CPI), stayed unchanged at 8.7% YoY for February versus 8.5% expected. However, the annual Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the ECB's preferred gauge of inflation, edged higher to 9.3% from 9.2% in January, compared to analysts' estimate of 9%. On Wednesday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve (Fed) President Neel Kashkari reiterated his previous calls for higher interest rates while citing the fears emanating from the services inflation. On the same line, ECB Governing Council member Madis Muller said, “Rate hikes are having an effect but inflation is still too high.” Further, ECB policymakers Joachim Nagel and Francois Villeroy de Galhau also highlighted the inflation fears to suggest the need for higher rates. It should be noted that the fading optimism over China’s economic growth recently joined the fears of the Sino-American tussles and exerted additional downside pressure on the EUR/USD prices.

"TheUSD/JPY pairis seen building on the overnight late rebound from the 135.25 area and steadily climbs back closer to the YTD peak at 136.90 during the early European session on Thursday. The pair currently trades around the 136.70 region, with bulls awaiting a sustained strength beyond the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 136.70 before placing fresh bets. The pair is pushed higher by theUS Dollar, which regains positive traction and reverses a part of the previous day's sharp retracement slide from a multi-week high amid a further rise in the US Treasury bond yields. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond climbs further beyond the 4.0% threshold, hitting its highest level since November 2022, and remains well supported by expectations for further policy tightening by the Fed. The markets seem convinced that the US central bank will keep interest rates higher for longer than previously estimated in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The bets were lifted by the overnight hawkish remarks by AtlantaFed President Raphael Bostic, reiterating the view that the policy rate needs to rise to the 5.00%-5.25% range and remain at that level well into 2024 (it is currently at 4.57%). Adding to this, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari reiterated that inflation in the US is still very high and that their job is to bring it down. Kashkari also noted that the risk of under-tightening is greater than the risk of over-tightening.  Furthermore, the US ISM Manufacturing Index showed that the Prices Paid sub-component accelerated to 51.3 in February from 44.5, further supporting then inflation narrative. The Japanese Yen (JPY), on the other hand, is undermined by the recent dovish remarks by the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and Deputy Governor nominee Shinichi Uchida, stressing the need to maintain the ultra-loose monetary policy.  That said, the cautious market mood - amid looming recession risks - could benefit the JPY's safe-haven status and cap the upside for the USD/JPY pair. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a convincing breakout through the 100-day SMA barrier before positioning for an extension of the recent appreciating move witnessed over the past month or so. Market participants now look forward to the release of the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data from the US, due later during the early North American session. Lower-than-expected Claims will continue to support the US Dollar and provide a bullish underpinning for USD/JPY. This, along with the US bond yields, will drive the USD demand and USD/JPY price dynamics.

"The Euro might finally steal the Follar’s thunder today, as the inflation rate for February will be published. The shared currency might receive considerable support, depending on how high the February rate will be in the end, economists at Commerzbank report. The hour of the Euro? “Market expects a slight decrease to 8,3% for the headline inflation and stable core inflation at 5.3%.

"The GBP/USD pair comes under some fresh selling pressure following the previous day's good two-way price swings and drifts lower through the first half of the European session. The downward trajectory drags spot prices back closer to mid-1.1900s in the last hour and well within the striking distance of a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A combination of factors assists theUS Dollarto regain strong positive traction, which, in turn, is seen exerting some downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed continue to push the US Treasury bond yields higher. Apart from this, a softer risk tone - amid looming recession risks - lends additional support to the safe-haven Greenback. Investors seem convinced that the Fed will stick to its hawkish stance in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. Furthermore, the incoming US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. Moreover, FOMC policymaker Neel Kashkari opened the door for a 50 bps hike at the next meeting in March. Kashkari noted that the risk of under-tightening is greater than the risk of over-tightening as inflation in the US is still very high. Separately, AtlantaFed President Raphael Bosticmaintained the view the policy rate needs to rise to the 5.00%-5.25% range and remain at that level well into 2024. This, in turn, remains supportive of elevated US bond yields and continues to underpin the Greenback. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond climbs further beyond the 4.0% threshold, to its highest level since November 2022, further fueling worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs. Apart from this, anxiety over the new UK-UKBrexitdeal on the Northern Ireland Protocol weighs on theBritish Poundand drags the GBP/USD pair lower. The price action, meanwhile, indicates that additional rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) is already fully priced in the markets. Moreover, some analysts still hope that the UK central bank would pause the current tightening cycle, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the downside. Spot prices, however, might still find some support near the 200-day SMA. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop now seems tilted firmly in favour of bearish traders. Hence, any attempted recovery could be seen as a selling opportunity and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly. Traders now look to the release of the usual US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims, which, along with the US bond yields, will drive the USD and provide some impetus to the GBP/USD pair.

"According to Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group,USD/JPYcould see its gains accelerated while above the 136.90 level. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we expected USD to trade sideways between 135.70 and 136.90. However, USD dropped to 135.24 before rebounding quickly to end the day little changed at 136.16 (-0.03%). The price actions offer not many clues and we expect USD to trade in a range today, likely between 135.40 and 136.60.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from yesterday (01 Mar, spot at 136.35) is still valid. As highlighted, USD must break and hold above 136.90 in the next 1-2 days or the chances of a move to 137.90 will rapidly diminish. Conversely, a break of the ‘strong support’ at 135.00 (no change in level) would indicate that the USD strength from two weeks ago has come to an end.”",1
"Today, the focus is on February Core Eurozone CPI. EUR/USD climbed to a fresh weekly high near 1.0700 on Wednesday.

Look for a new cycle high in Core Eurozone CPI “The release of February's CoreEurozoneCPI looks likely to exceed the 5.3% year-on-year consensus. We have had little push-back from the European Central Bank against the repricing of the cycle, which now seems to price the deposit rate above 4.00% early next year. That seems excessive, but let's see what today's release of theECBminutes has to say.” “Also important today will be comments from consistent hawk, Isabel Schnabel, speaking at the Money Market Contact Group in Frankfurt.

"The annualized EurozoneHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices(HICP) comes in a tad softer at 8.5% in February vs. January’s 8.6%, the latest data published by Eurostat showed on Thursday. The market expected the inflation gauge to ease to 8.2% in the reported period. The core HICP climbs to 5.6% YoY in February when compared to 5.3% expected and 5.3% seen in the January reading. On a monthly basis, the old continent’s HICP unexpectedly jumped by 0.8% in February vs. -0.3% expectations and -0.2% previous. The core HICP arrived at 0.8% last month as against the 0% expected and -0.8% registered in January. The Euro area inflation data is featured a trading day after Germany’s annual HICP for February, which rose by 9.3%, beating 9.0% estimates while following a 9.2% increase seen in January. The ECB inflation target is 2%. The bloc’s HICP figures hold significance, as it would help investors reprice the European Central Bank’s (ECB) rate hike expectations.

No reaction in the FX universe after ChairwomanLagardereiterated that a 50 bps rate hike remains on the table at the March meeting, at the time when she added that decisions on the future rate path will be data dependent, although how far up rates could go remains uncertain.

"The AUD/USD pair comes under some renewed selling pressure on Thursday and maintains its offered tone through the first half of the European session. The pair is currently placed around the 0.6725-0.6720 region and remains well within the striking distance of its lowest level since early January low touched the previous day. TheUS Dollarregains positive traction and reverses a part of the previous day's sharp retracement slide from a multi-week top, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor weighing on the AUD/USD pair. Growing acceptance that the Fed will stick to its hawkish stance for longer continues to push the US Treasury bond yields higher. Apart from this, the prevalent cautious market mood - amid looming recession risks - further benefits the safe-haven Greenback and contributes to driving flows away from the risk-sensitiveAussie. The markets seem convinced that the US central bank will continue to tighten its monetary policy in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. Moreover, the incoming US macro data pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs and should allow the Fed to keep interest rates higher. Adding to this, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari opened the door for a 50 bps hike at the next meeting in March and lifts the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond to its highest level since November. Meanwhile, the overnight optimism led by the upbeat Chinese PMI prints for February fades rather quickly amid looming recession risk. This is evident from a generally softer tone around the equity markets, which lends additional support to the USD and suggests that the path of least resistance for the AUD/USD pair is to the downside. That said, it will still be prudent to wait for sustained weakness below the 0.6700 mark before placing fresh bearish bets and positioning for a further near-term depreciating move. Market participants now look forward to the release of the Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data from the US, due later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, should influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair. Technical levels to watch watch AUD/USD  ",0

"The EUR/USD loses traction in the mid-North American session and trades below its opening price by 0.83%, below the 1.0600 mark. Reasons like unemployment claims in the United States (US) easing triggered investors’ reaction, that perhaps their inflation view is wrong, sending US bond yield skyrocketing. Hence, the US Dollar (USD) strengthened to the Euro (EUR) detriment. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD trades at 1.0575. The US Department of Labor (DoL), revealed that the number of people who filed for unemployment benefits for the first time in the week ending on February 25 was 190K, which was lower than the 195K predicted by experts. The market reacted negatively, sending US Treasury bond yields above the 4% threshold and underpinning the US Dollar. The EUR/USD tumbled below 1.0600 on the initial reaction following US Initial Jobless Claims data, while the US Dollar rallied. At the time of typing, the USDollar Index(DXY), a measure of the buck’s value vs. a basket of six currencies, advances 0.73%, at 105.141. On the Euroarea inflationary figures were unveiled. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), rose 8.5% YoY, above the previous month’s 8.6%. However, the reading missed the market expectations of 8.2%. Excluding volatile items, the so-called core inflation, on its annual reading, printed at 5.6%, higher than the previous and expected 5.3%. Even though figures were higher than expected, investors had already priced in a 50 bps rate hike by the European Central Bank (ECB) as announced by its President ChristineLagardein its last meeting presser. However, recent data have ECB policymakers split on what signal the bank should send to the markets. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the ECB are expected to raise rates. The former would likely hike 25 bps, as shown by money market futures, but further data to be revealed ahead of March’s meeting could put into discussion a 50 bps rate hike. On the European side, the ECB is leaning toward 50 bps, though recent data could open the door for higher rates. EUR/USD Technical analysis After rallying toward the weekly high of 1.0691, the EUR/USD plunges, erasing almost its Wednesday gains. The EUR/USD clashed with the 20 and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 1.0664 and 1.0657, respectively, and has reached a daily low of 1.0576. Albeitthe EUR/USD pairturned south, its bias remains neutral, but a daily close below 1.0600 could pave the way for further downside. Therefore, the EUR/USD first support would be the March 2 daily low of 1.0576. Break below, and the 100-day EMA at 1.0550 would be tested by sellers ahead of falling to the 200-day EMA at 1.0533. Conversely, the EUR/USD first resistance would be the psychological 1.0600 figure. Once conquered, the Euro could appreciate toward the confluence of the 50/20-day EMA at 1.0657/1.0665, followed by a test of 1.0700.  What to watch? ",0
"The broader US stock indices are trying to dodge a bearish bullet on the rebound back to the upside help by Fed's Bostics comments.  The EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD are also trying to dodge it's own bullets. EURUSD: Looking at the EURUSD, the low price reached 1.0576. That was the low of the swing area between 1.0576 and 1.05853. Moving below that level would have increased the bearish bias for the EURUSD (see post here).  Instead the price has rotated back to the upside and looks back toward the 100 hour moving average 1.0603 -  and above that -  the 200 hour moving average 1.06171.  If the pair is able to get up above those levels, it would tilt the short term bearish bias back in favor of the buyers. USDJPY: Looking at the USDJPY, it moved back above its 100 day moving average 136.901, and approached the high price for the day at 137.097. The 200 day moving average is above that 100 day MA at at 137.234. However, the Bostic comments have since pushed the price back below the 100 day moving average, dodging that bullish bias shift.   The current price trades at 136.71. What now?  On the downside the rising 100 hour moving average at 136.308 is the next key target to get to and through if the bias is to start a short-term shift more to the downside.  That level is still 40 or so pips away, but the price is also back below the 100 day moving average.  The battle continues between sellers against the daily moving averages and buyers against the 100 hour moving average (and below that the 200 hour moving average - green line). GBPUSD: The GBPUSD moved back down to test its 200 day moving average of 1.19706. That was also near the low price from Monday near the same level. That low could not be broken, however, and the price has since moved back to the upside and trades at 1.1951. The next key target to get back above includes the 100 day moving average at 1.1968.  IF the GBPUSD can get above that moving average, it would avert closing below that key MA level for the first time since November 9. The EURUSD, USDJPY and GBPUSD are all trying to dodge a dollar bullish technical tilt on their respective charts.  Will it be enough to tilt the USD buyers into sellers going forward?  We will see if the aforementioned targets in each pair can now be reached and rebroken.",1

"EUR/USD treads water around 1.0600, after posting the biggest daily loss in a month, as traders await more clues amid the battle between the hawks of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). That said, the quote dropped heavily the previous day but couldn’t rule out the weekly gains amid the US Dollar’s limited capacity to win the bids, despite strong US Treasury bond yields and hawkish Fed commentary. With this, the Euro pair remains sidelined during the initial hour of Friday’s Asian session after pausing the bears around 1.0575 a few minutes back. On Thursday, United States Treasury bond yields rallied multi-month high amid escalating fears of inflation and higher rates from major central banks, mainly from the Fed. The same allowed theUS Dollarto post the biggest daily jump since early February. However, late Thursday’s comments from Federal Reserve Bank ofAtlanta President Raphael Bosticjoined the cautious mood ahead of the US ISM Services PMI for February to probe the greenback bulls afterward. The benchmark US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to a fresh high since early November 2022 while piercing the 4.0% threshold whereas the two-year counterpart rallied to the highest levels since 2007 to 4.94%. It should be noted that the strong yields initially weighed on the US equities but the comments from Fed’s Bostic allowed Wall Street to close on a positive side. Fed’s Bostic said on Thursday that the central bank could be in position to pause the current tightening cycle by mid to late summer. On the other hand, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said on Thursday that more rate hikes are required to bring inflation back in control. She added that the extent of interest rate hikes will be determined by incoming data. Other than the hawkish Fed, US data suggesting a tight labor market and higher wage costs also underpinned the inflation woes and helped the US Dollar to remain firm.  On Thursday, US Jobless Claims dropped to 190K during the week ended on February 24 versus 195K market forecasts and 192K prior. Further, Nonfarm Productivity for the fourth quarter (Q4) eased to 1.7% from 3.0% prior and 2.6% market forecasts while the Unit Labor Costs jumped 3.6% versus 1.6% analysts’ estimations and 1.1% previous readings. In the case of theEurozone, the latest accounts of the ECB February policy meeting were published on Thursday and stated, “Governing Council members agreed that further increases in key rates are required for policy to enter restrictive territory,” reported Reuters. On the same line, European Central Bank (ECB) President ChristineLagarde, said in an interview with Spanish TV on Thursday that the case for a 50 bps rate hike this month is still on the table as inflation is still too high. Talking about the data, the annualized EurozoneHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices(HICP) came in a tad lower to 8.5% in February versus 8.6% prior and 8.2% market forecasts. However, the Core HICP grew 5.6% during the said month when compared to 5.3% analysts’ expectations and previous reading. The monthly figures were quite impressive as the headline HICP jumped by 0.8% in February vs. -0.3% expectations and -0.2% previous while the core HICP arrived at 0.8% last month as against the 0% expected and -0.8% registered in January. Looking ahead, EUR/USD traders should pay attention to the second-readings of the Eurozone and German activity numbers ahead of the US ISM Services PMI for February, expected 54.5 versus 55.2 prior. It’s worth noting that the stated PMI allowed the US Dollar to rally the previous month after it gained support from the strong USNonfarm Payrolls(NFP), up for publication in the next week.

The Cable is expected to be dumped by the market participants as the street is anticipating a pause or a deceleration in the pace of interest rate hiking by theBank of England(BoE) despite the fact that the United Kingdom inflation is still trending in the double-digit figure. Analysts at Commerzbank are of the view that “Bailey is not really committing very firmly to further strong tightening measures. In view of an inflation rate in double-digits, I would have hoped for more commitment toward rate hikes. But obviously, the BoE is not willing to inflict (further) harm on the economy and the population to get a grip of inflation.” Meanwhile, themarket sentimentlooks positive as risk-sensitive assets like S&P500 has shown a decent recovery on Thursday.

The downward-sloping trendline of the aforementioned chart pattern is placed from the February high at 1.2402. The 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2060 will act as a major barricade for the Pound Sterling. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has slipped below 40.00 from the 40.00-60.00 range, indicating that the bearish momentum could be triggered. A confident break below February 17 low at 1.1915 will drag the Cable firmly towards January 5 low at 1.1875 followed by the round-level support at 1.1800. On the contrary, a move above February 24 high at 1.2040 will drive the asset towards February 23 high around 1.2080.

Key findings All but one of the 28 economists in the Feb. 27-March 2 Reuters poll said the RBA would raise its official cash rate by 25 basis points, reaching a more than decade-high of 3.60%, at its March 7 meeting. One saw a 15 basis-point move. A strong minority of more than one-third of respondents, 10 of 28, predicted rates to peak even higher at 4.10% next quarter. One economist had a peak of 4.35% in the third quarter. Several economists foresee trouble ahead for the Australian economy, partly because higher interest rates have already slowed activity in the housing market, where prices are expected to fall more than double the correction during the 2008 financial crisis. Just over a quarter of economists, 8 of 28, forecast at least one rate cut by year-end. Also read:AUD/USD Price Analysis: Attempts to deliver a bullish reversal",1
"TheUSD/JPY pairhas witnessed buying interest after dropping to near 136.50 in the Asian session. The asset has picked strength as the Statistics Bureau of Japan has conveyed that Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) softened heavily in February. The annual headline CPI has dropped to 3.4% from the consensus of 4.1% and the prior release of 4.4%. Contrary to that, the core CPI that excludes the impact of energy and food prices have improved to 3.2% from 3.1% as expected and the former release of 3.0%. It seems like the inflationary pressures have been exceptionally battered by the recent fall in food and energy prices. A decline in headline Tokyo inflation indicates that the impact of higher energy and food prices has started fading now, therefore, it could be considered that Tokyo inflation has peaked for now. Reuters reported that “The pace of inflation slowed due in part to the government's energy subsidies to ease the pain on households from soaring electricity bills.” It is worth noting that the novel Bank of Japan (BoJ) leadership has been favoring current monetary policy, which is expansionary in nature, as inflation is coming from international forces and not from domestic demand. Speculation for the Japanese Yen might remain elevated as BoJ Governor Nominee Kazuo Ueda could abandon or phase out Yield Curve Control (YCC).

It’s worth noting that, the US-China tension at the Group of 20 Nations (G20) meeting, amid the former’s push for sanctions on countries having strong ties with Russia and aiding Moscow in war with Ukraine, previously probed the sentiment. However, the dovish Fed comments and chatters of the Sino-American trade talks seemed to have pushed back the risk-off mood afterward.

That said, the Yen pair renews its intraday low near 136.50 during early Friday, snapping a two-day winning streak at the latest. In doing so, the quote remains pressured inside a one-week-old rising wedge bearish chart formation. It’s worth noting that the USD/JPY pair’s downside break of a short-term support line, now resistance around 137.00, on Thursday joined the bearish MACD signals to keep sellers hopeful of witnessing further declines. The same highlights the lower line of the aforementioned rising wedge, close to 135.85 by the press time, as the key support. It should be observed, however, that the 200-Hour Moving Average (HMA) level surrounding 135.60 acts as an extra filter towards the south before convincing the USD/JPY bears to aim for 132.80 theoretical target of the rising wedge, if at all the prices remain weak past 135.85. Meanwhile, a descending resistance line from the latest peak restricts the USD/JPY pair’s immediate upside near 136.75, a break of which will highlight the previous support line from Wednesday and the wedge’s top line, respectively around 137.00 and 137.20 at the latest.

Talks surrounding the resumption of the Sino-American trade dialogue seemed to have triggered the market’s optimism of late, which appears to favor the AUD/USD buyers. On the same line could be the hopes for an easy monetary policy from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). However, the US-China tension at the Group of 20 Nations (G20) meeting, amid the former’s push for sanctions on countries having strong ties with Russia and aiding Moscow in the war with Ukraine, pokes the optimism and checks the Aussie pair’s upside momentum. It should be noted that the firmer China data and mixed Aussie figures, as well as the unimpressive US statistics, also challenge the pair traders. That said, China’s Caixin Services PMI traced the latest activity data for the dragon nation while printing 55.00 figures for February, versus 50.0 market forecasts and 52.9 previous readings. At home, Australia’s S&P Global PMIs for February came in firmer and help the AUD/USD buyers to keep the reins. Though, downbeat prints of Australia Home Loans and Investment Lending for Homes, for January, seem to cap the quote of late. On the other hand, the US Jobless Claims dropped to 190K during the week ended on February 24 versus 195K market forecasts and 192K prior. Further, Nonfarm Productivity for the fourth quarter (Q4) eased to 1.7% from 3.0% prior and 2.6% market forecasts while the Unit Labor Costs jumped 3.6% versus 1.6% analysts’ estimations and 1.1% previous readings. Elsewhere, Thursday’s statements from Federal Reserve Bank ofAtlanta President Raphael Bosticrenewed concerns about the Fed’s policy pivot as the decision-maker said, “The central bank could be in a position to pause the current tightening cycle by mid to late summer.” It should be observed, however, that Boston Fed President Susan Collins kept supporting the higher rates for longer as she said, “More rate hikes are required to bring inflation back in control.” Against this backdrop, the 10-year coupons drop two basis points to 4.05% while its two-year counterpart seesaws around 4.89% by the press time. Further, S&P 500 Futures struggle for clear directions after mild losses. The latest Reuters poll suggesting a peak in theRBArate during the second quarter (Q2) of 2023 joins the polls suggesting the Fed’s policy pivot to challenge the AUD/USD traders. To overcome the indecision, today’s US ISM Services PMI, expected at 54.5 versus 55.2 prior readings, will be crucial ahead of the next week’s key events. Technical analysis AUD/USD portrays a one-month-old falling wedge bullish chart formation. However, a clear break of the 0.6775 hurdle becomes necessary for the buyers to retake control.

"USD/JPY is juggling in a limited range around 136.60 in the Asian session. The asset has rebounded from 136.50 and is aiming to recapture the immediate resistance of 137.00 as the Tokyo Inflation has softened dramatically for the first time after a nine-month period escalation. Lower food and energy prices have trimmed the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) while the core inflation that strips off the impact of food and oil steadily improved. The USDollar Index(DXY) is on the verge of delivering a downside break below 104.80 amid an absence of recovery signals. The downside pressure in the USD Index has built amid modest dovish commentary from Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller. Fed Waller cited February’s inflation recovery as a one-time blip and the price pressures will resume their downtrend from next month. S&P500 futures have recovered the majority of losses recorded in the Asian session, portraying a decent recovery in therisk appetiteof the market participants. The demand for US government bonds has recovered marginally amid ease in the risk aversion theme. This has pushed the 10-year US Treasury yields below 4.05%. Upbeat US Services PMI could fuel hawkish Fed bets Anxiety among the market participants is gradually escalating ahead of the release of the United States Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Services PMI data. The economic data is seen lower at 54.5 from the former release of 55.2. The New Orders Index which conveys the forward demand is expected to decline to 58.5 from the prior figure of 60.4. Earlier, the US Manufacturing PMI displayed a fourth-time contraction, however, the New Orders Index was exceptionally higher. A surprise rise in the Services New Orders Index along with the already upbeat Manufacturing demand outlook will clear that the overall forward demand is in an expansionary mode and could propel the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which will bolster expectations of more rates from the Federal Reserve. Atlanta Fed Bank PresidentRaphael Bosticsaid on Thursday that the central bank could be in a position to pause the current tightening cycle by mid-to-late summer. He favors a 25 basis points (bps) rate hike in March but has left room opened for more hawkish rateoutlookif inflation and labor market data come in stronger. Tokyo Inflation surprisingly decline Bank of Japan (BoJ) policymakers are spending sleepless nights, designing strategies for achieving a stable 2% inflation. The central bank is infusing stimulus into the Japanese economy to fuel wages and domestic demand. Japan’s inflation was fueling constantly, however, a recent decline has alarmed the Bank of Japan policymakers. The annual headline CPI has dropped to 3.4% from the consensus of 4.1% and the prior release of 4.4%. Contrary to that, the core CPI that excludes the impact of energy and food prices have improved to 3.2% from 3.1% as expected and the former release of 3.0%. It seems like the inflationary pressures have been exceptionally battered by the recent fall in food and energy prices. Reuters reported that “The pace of inflation slowed due in part to the government's energy subsidies to ease the pain on households from soaring electricity bills.” Commentary from Bank of Japan Governor Nominee Kazuo Ueda on a fresh decline in the Tokyo CPI will be keenly watched. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has ordered the ruling party to draft additional measures to counter price hikes, as reported by the Kyodonewsagency. The agenda behind that would be supporting households to offset the impact of items such as food and energy, which are highly inflated. On the economic front, a poll by Reuters reported Japan's economy is likely to grow a tad faster than initially estimated in the fourth quarter. RevisedGross Domestic Product(GDP), scheduled for March 9, might grow at 0.8% annualized in October-December, versus an initial estimate of 0.6%. USD/JPY technical outlook  USD/JPY is making efforts in overstepping the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement (placed from October 21 high at 151.94 to January 16 low at 127.22) at 136.85. A bear cross, represented by the 20-and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 133.27, adds to the downside filters. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has shifted into the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates that the bullish momentum is already active. USD/JPY  ",1
"In the view of UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang,EUR/USDis expected to navigate within the 1.0530-1.0700 range in the next few weeks. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Our expectations for EUR to advance further was incorrect it dropped to a low of 1.0574. While there is scope for EUR to weaken further, any decline is likely part of a lower trading range of 1.0565/1.0655. To look at it another way, a sustained drop below 1.0565 is unlikely.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We indicated yesterday (02 Mar, spot at 1.0665) that EUR rebound further but a sustained rise above 1.0750 is not high. We did not expect the rapid manner in which EUR gave up most of its gains from the previous day. Instead of rebounding further, EUR is likely to consolidate and trade between 1.0530 and 1.0700 for now.” ",1
"Economists at HSBC expect the Euro to appreciate in the coming weeks. EUR could benefit from a clear indication of further tightening “Barring exceptionally hawkish US data or geopolitical deterioration, we believe EUR/USD could stage a modest recovery in the coming few weeks.” “The EUR has been slow to capitalise on the combination of an improving growth/inflation mix alongside a still-hawkish ECB. It may be better placed to gain as upward USD momentum falters.” “For the ECB meeting on 16 March, the key for the EUR is how PresidentLagardeguides expectations for the May meeting and beyond. Any strong hints that the tightening pace is set to slow to 25 bps could weigh on the EUR. Conversely, the EUR could benefit from a clear indication of further tightening. The balance of risks may tip the needle in favour of the EUR.” ",1
"GBP/USDcould accelerate its downside once 1.1900 is cleared, suggest UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We did not expect GBP to drop sharply to 1.1924 yesterday (we were expecting GBP to trade sideways). Downward momentum has improved, albeit not much. GBP could weaken further but a sustained decline below the major support at 1.1900 is unlikely. Resistance is at 1.1975, a breach of 1.2005 would indicate that GBP is not weakening further.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our latest narrative was from Tuesday (28 Feb, spot at 1.2065) where we held the view that GBP is likely to consolidate and trade in a broad range of 1.1970 and 1.2150. Yesterday, GBP took out 1.1970 and dropped to a low of 1.1924. Downward momentum is beginning to build. However, GBP has to crack another major support at 1.1900 before a sustained decline is likely. The chance of GBP breaking 1.1900 will remain intact as long as the ‘strong resistance’ (currently at 1.2045) is not breached within the next few days. Looking ahead, the next level to watch below 1.1900 is at the Jan’s low near 1.1840.”",0
"UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang see diminishing bets for further weakness inAUD/USDin the short term. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that ‘despite the relatively strong bounce, there has been no significant increase in upward momentum and AUD is unlikely to strengthen much further’, and we expected AUD to trade within a range of 0.6715/0.6790. AUD subsequently traded in a relatively quiet manner between 0.6707 and 0.6766. The price actions appear to be consolidative and we expect AUD to trade sideways between 0.6700 and 0.6760 today.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from yesterday (02 Mar, spot at 0.6755) is still valid. As highlighted, downward momentum is waning rapidly and the odds for AUD to weaken further have diminished considerably. However, only a breach of the ‘strong resistance’ at 0.6800 would confirm that the AUD weakness that started two weeks ago has run its course.”",1
"The USD/JPY pair comes under some selling pressure on Friday and reverses the previous day's positive move to its highest level since December 20 - just above the 137.00 mark. The intraday downfall picks up pace during the early European session and drags spot prices to a fresh daily low, around the 136.25-136.20 area in the last hour. Retreating US Treasury bond yields trigger a modestUS Dollarpullback and turn out to be a key factor dragging the USD/JPY pair lower. Apart from this, a softer risk tone benefits the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and contributes to the offered tone surrounding the major. Any meaningful corrective pullback, however, still seems elusive amid hawkish Fed expectations, which should act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and the Greenback. In fact, the markets seem convinced that the US central bank will keep interest rates higher for longer to tame stubbornly high inflation. Moreover, a slew of FOMC membersthis weekopened the door for a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the March policy meeting. This lifted the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond to its highest level since last November and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note to levels last seen in July 2007 on Thursday. In contrast, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its dovish stance for the foreseeable future. In fact, the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda stressed the need to maintain the ultra-loose policy to support the fragile economy and said earlier this week that the central bank isn't seeking a quick move away from a decade of massive easing. Hence, the market focus will remain glued to the upcoming BoJ monetary policy meeting, scheduled next Friday. In the meantime, the divergent Fed-BoJoutlookshould lend support to theUSD/JPY pairand limit any meaningful downside, at least for the time being. Market participants now look forward to the release of the US ISM Services PMI, which, along with a scheduled speech by Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, might influence the USD. Apart from this, the broader risk sentiment could assist traders to grab short-term opportunities on the last day of the week. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",0
"Widening policy rate differential withECBsuggests CHF weakness ahead, in the opinion of economists at CIBC Capital Markets. SNB to remain potentially activist in the FX space “Beyond the prospect of ongoing monetary tightening, we can expect the central bank to remain potentially activist in the FX space. However, we would expect any activity to be commensurate with the pursuance of the goal of price stability rather than attempting to reduce the balance sheet.” “We expect additionalSNBpolicy activity, resulting in a 1.75% terminal rate. However, in view of the assumption of the ECB hiking rates towards 3.50%, the widening in nominal rate differential favours a modest uptrend in EUR/CHF.” “Q2 2023: 1.00 | Q3 2023: 1.01 (EUR/CHF)” ",1
"Further appreciation potential for EUR/USD is likely to be limited for now, in the view of economists at Commerzbank. ECB rate expectations have gone far “The market expects interest rates to peak at just under 4%. In our view, current market expectations are already quite aggressive. A large share of the upside risks for inflation that emerged over the past weeks is likely to be priced into the rateoutlookalready, which limits the Euro’s future appreciation potential.” “In view of stubbornly high underlying inflation momentum dovish resistance within theECBmight prevent a sufficient tightening of monetary policy, in particular if core inflation tends downwards over the course of next year. If signs indicating this increase, the Euro would be at risk of recording significant losses.” ",0
"The GBP/USD pair attracts fresh buyers in the vicinity of a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and reverses a part of the overnight losses back closer to the weekly low. The pair sticks to its intraday gains and is currently placed near the top end of the daily range, just a few pips below the 1.2000 psychological mark. A modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields prompts some selling around theUS Dollar, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the GBP/USD pair higher. TheBritish Pounddraws additional support from rising bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE). It is worth recalling that the BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday that some further increase in bank rates may turn out to be appropriate, though added that nothing is decided. This was followed by hawkish remarks by the BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill on Thursday, noting that Britain's economy is showing slightly more momentum than expected and pay growth is proving a bit faster than the central bankforecastlast month. The downside for the USD, however, seems cushioned, at least for the time being, amid firming expectations for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. The US CPI, PPI and the PCE Price Index released recently indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped. Moreover, the incoming upbeat US macro data, including the Initial Jobless Claims on Thursday, pointed to an economy that remains resilient, which should allow the US central bank to stick to its hawkish stance for longer. Adding to this, a slew of FOMC members backed the case for higher rate hikes to tame stubbornly high inflation. This should act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and continue to lend some support to the Greenback. It is worth recalling that the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond rose to its highest level since last November and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note had shot to levels last seen in July 2007 on Thursday. This, along with the GBP/USD pair's two-way price action witnessed over the past four weeks or so, warrants some caution for aggressive traders and positioning for a firm near-term direction. Next on tap is the release of the final UK Services PMI, which will be followed by the US ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI later during the early North American session. The data might provide some impetus to the major and allow traders to grab short-term opportunities on the last day of the week. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
"A probable advance inUSD/JPYto the 137.90 region could be running out of steam, according to UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we expected USD to trade sideways between 135.40 and 136.60. However, USD rose briefly above 137.00 (high of 137.09) before retreating quickly. Despite the advance, upward momentum has barely improved. Today, there is scope for USD to edge higher but a break of 137.30 is unlikely. On the downside, a breach of 136.20 would indicate that the current mild upward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have held a positive USD view for more than 2 weeks now. In our most recent narrative from two days ago (01 Mar, spot at 136.35), we noted that USD ‘must break and hold above 136.90 in the next 1-2 days or the chances of a move to 137.90 will rapidly diminish’. While USD rose to a high of 137.09 in NY trade, it retreated and closed at 136.76. Upward momentum has improved a tad but while theoutlookfor USD is still positive, the major resistance at 137.90 could be out of reach this time around.

"The AUD/USD pair regains positive traction on the last day of the week and builds on its steady intraday descent through the first half of the European session. The momentum lifts spot prices to a fresh daily high, around the 0.6765 region in the last hour, and is sponsored by the emergence of fresh selling around theUS Dollar. A modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields is turning out to be a key factor exerting some downward pressure on the buck. Adding to this, the upbeat Chinese macro data fueled optimism about a strong recovery in the world's second-largest economy, which further dents the Greenback's safe-haven status and provides an additional boost to the China-proxy Australian Dollar. That said, a combination of factors might hold back bulls from placing aggressive bets around the AUD/USD pair and keep a lid on any further gains, at least for the time being. Firming expectations that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation should act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and lend support to the USD. The bets were lifted by hawkish commentary by a slew of influential FOMC members, stressing the need for higher rate hikes to fully gain control over inflation. This had pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond to its highest level since last November and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note to levels last seen in July 2007 on Thursday. Furthermore, worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs continue to weigh on investors' sentiment. This is evident from the prevalent cautious mood around the equity markets, which should further help limit losses for the Greenback and contribute to capping the upside for the AUD/USD pair. Even from a technical perspective, the recent breakdown below the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) favours bearish trades and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices remains to the downside. Market participants might also refrain from placing aggressive bets ahead of next week's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) monetary policy meeting. In the meantime, traders on Friday will take cues from the US ISM Services PMI, due for release later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields and the risk sentiment, will drive the USD demand and produce short-term trading opportunities around the AUD/USD pair. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",1

EUR/USD now looks at US data EUR/USD keeps the choppy price action well and sound so far this week amidst an equally vacillating performance in the greenback, while yields on both sides of the ocean now give away some gains and investors continue to monitor messages from both the ECB and the Fed. On the latter, ECB’s Vice-President De Guindos suggested earlier that headline inflation should fall below 6% at some point in mid-year, at the time when he reiterated that decisions on future rate hikes will remain data-dependent and that the economy of the region is doing better than expected. His colleague Vasle left the door open to further rate raises after the March event, a view shared by Board member Müller. In addition, Müller was unable to predict how far up rates may go. In the domestic calendar, final figures saw Services PMI in Germany and the broader Euroland at 50.9 and 52.7, respectively, for the month of February. In addition, Producer Prices in the euro area contracted 2.8% MoM in January and rose 15% from a year earlier and earlier data saw Germany’s trade surplus widen to €16.7B in January.

What to look for around EUR EUR/USD regains some balance and looks to extend the trade beyond the 1.0600 yardstick amidst the broad-based consolidative mood. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event.

"The GBP/USD pair attracts some dip-buying on Friday and recovers a major part of the previous day's slide to the 1.1920-1.1915 support zone.  The pair maintains its bid tone around the 1.2000 psychological mark through the early North American session and is supported by broad-basedUS Dollarweakness. Looking at the broader picture, the two-way price moves witnessed over the past four weeks or so constitute the formation of a rectangle on the daily chart. The lower end of the trading band coincides with a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and should now act as a pivotal point. A convincing break below will make the GBP/USD pair vulnerable to weaken further below the 1.1900 mark and test the YTD low, around the 1.1840 region touched in January. Some follow-through selling will complete a bearish double-top pattern formed near the 1.2445-1.2450 area and pave the way for deeper losses. On the flip side, the overnight swing high, around the 1.2035 area, might act as an immediate hurdle ahead of the 1.2065-1.2070 supply zone. Any subsequent move-up could attract fresh sellers near the 1.2100 mark and remain capped near the 50-day SMA strong barrier, currently around the 1.2135-1.2140 area. Some follow-through buying could lift the GBP/USD pair towards the 1.2200 mark en route to the February 14 peak, around the 1.2265-1.2270 region.

"TheUSD/JPY pairstops and reverses the early selling bias on Friday and spikes higher after the release of US data from ISM compiled from surveys of purchasing managers in the services sector beat expectations. The results suggested the American economy is still in fine form and the Fed will need to continue tightening policy aggressively in its wrestle with the beast of inflation. Nevertheless, gains proved temporary as the pair gradually fell back down to the lower 136s after the initial furious rally higher. TheISMNon-Manufactruing PMI data for February, showed a rise to 55.1, roundly beating expectations of 54.5, and almost pipping the previous month's 55.2.US Dollarpairs reacted immediately, and began rising as traders bet on the Federal Reserve having to step in with sterner disinflationary measures, perhaps even raising interest rates more aggressively than is currently expected, with probabilities steadily rising of the higher 50 bps rate hike coming from the Fed in March. The data also showed a rise in the Employment component of the survey, to 54.0 from 50.0 and New Orders to 62.6 from 60.4. Price Paid fell to 65.6 from 67.8, however, offsetting the hype marginally and suggesting a slight easing in inflationary forces. The Business Activity component, meanwhile showed a fall 56.3 from 60.4. From a technical perspective, the USD/JPY pair is in a short-to-medium term uptrend which is expected to extend given a lack of reversal signs so far. Yet lately it has struggled to break above the 100 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) between 136.50 and 137.00 and these appear to be successfully baring further growth. If bulls can successfully break above them, however, it will also confirm a breakout through the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent pullback from over a three-decade high and pave the way for additional gains. The USD/JPY pair might then accelerate the move to reclaim the 138.00 mark en route to the 138.75 zone, the 139.00 round figure and the 139.60 region (50% Fibo. level). On the flip side, sustained weakness below the 136.00 level might prompt some technical selling and drag the USD/JPY pair to the weekly low, around the 135.25 region. It would require a break below the key 134.05 February 24 low – the last key higher low of the previous uptrend – to reverse the sequence of rising peaks and troughs and define the beginning of a new downtrend. A key event for the USD/JPY pair will be the Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy meeting next week. That said, a convincing break below the 134.05 low could make spot prices vulnerable to sliding further towards the 23.6% Fibo. level support, just ahead of the 133.00 mark.

US data lifts Dollar marginally The last first-tier release of the week was theUS ISM Service PMIfor February which came at 55.1, below January's 55.2, and slightly above the market consensus of 54.5. The Prices Paid Index sub-component dropped from 67.8 to 65.6, still above expectations for a slide to 64.5. The Employment Index jumped to 54, versus expectations of a decline to 49.8. The numbers gave the US Dollar some momentum, but price action remain subdued on Friday with major pairs consolidating. The greenback is moving with a positive intraday bias supported by a rebound in US yields. The US 10-year yield rose from 3.97% to 4.02%. The GBP/USD is off highs as it keeps moving in a range above 1.1900. It is trading marginally higher for the week, hovering around the 20-week Simple Moving Average. A firm break under 1.1900 should open the doors to more losses. While on the upside, the immediate resistance emerges at 1.2055 (20-day SMA) followed by the 1.2150 area. A firm break above should clear the way for 1.2200 and more. Technical levels GBP/USD  ",0
"The AUD/USD jumped from around weekly lows below 0.6700 and climbed 0.44% on Friday.

The US ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI for February was 55.1, slightly lower than the previous month’s 55.2. However, it exceeded expectations of 54.5, indicating that business activity is still strong. The Prices Paid Index subcomponent, looked by investors for inflationary pressures, increased to 65.6, above estimates of 64.5. Although it was lower than January’s 67.8, data would keep traders tracking Federal Reserve’s (Fed) officials’ speakers throughout the day. US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) speakers highlighted the importance of tackling inflation towards the 2% target. On Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller commented that inflation was not easing as expected and signaled his openness to increase rates if price pressures don’t reduce.

The Boston Fed President Susan Collins commented that inflation remains too high and added that Aside from this, theEurozone(EU) revealed S&P Global Services and Composite PMIs came above previous readings. Meanwhile, inflationary figures announced on Thursday came below last month’s data but above estimates, a reason for the ECB to continue to hike interest rates. Even though figures were higher than expected, investors had already priced in a 50 bps rate hike by the European Central Bank (ECB) as announced by its PresidentChristine Lagardein its last meeting presser. However, recent data haveECBpolicymakers split on what signal the bank should send to the markets. EUR/USD Technical levels EUR/USD  ",1

Both of them are near the 0.6743 level. The current price trades at 0.6736. If the price can remain below those moving averages, it would build the bias to the downside This week the price has been trading above and below the 100 day moving average as traders ponder risk-on or risk-off. The high price was reached on Wednesday at 0.67842. The low price was also on Wednesday at 0.6694. At the high, it tested the swing low from February 23. That level was broken on February 24 and the market scooted lower. The high price today stalled ahead of the 200 hour moving average. Looking back in time the price has not traded above the 200 hour moving average since February 15. On February 16, February 20 and 21st, the price tested the 200 hour moving average only to find willing sellers. Going forward it would take a move back above that moving average to give the buyers some hope and control. The moving average currently comes in at 0.67712. Above it is the 200 day moving average at 0.67927. The high price on Wednesday fell short of that target. All of which keeps the sellers in control. On the downside the lows for the week just below the 0.6700 level will need to be broken to open the downside for further selling.  On the downside, the 0.6628 to 0.6678 area on the daily chart below, is the next target area (see red numbered circles on the chart below). The 50% midpoint of the move up from the October low is within that area at 0.66633.",0
" “Underlying inflation in theEurozonewill stay high in the near term so a 50 basis point European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate increase later this month is increasingly certain,” ECB PresidentChristine Lagardetold Spanish media group Vocento per Reuters. Lagarde said in Sunday’s speech, per Reuters, that the flagged increase is now ""very very likely"" but she also warned that underlying inflation, which filters out volatile food and fuel prices, could stay uncomfortably high even as the overall inflation rate drops in the coming months. ""In the short term, core inflation is going to be high,"" per ECB’s Lagarde. ECB’s Lagarde also stated that they must continue to take whatever measures are necessary to bring inflation back to 2%. And they will do so. “Eurozone economy is holding up better than feared and output should accelerate from near stagnation in the closing quarter of 2022,” adds the central banker.

"GBP/USD bulls take a breather around 1.2030 during Monday’s initial Asian session, after posting the biggest weekly jump since mid-January. In doing so, the Cable pair fails to extend the previous day’s upside break of the one-month-old descending resistance line, now support around 1.2020. However, the Cable price is yet to drop back below the resistance-turned-support and the MACD signals are bullish too, which in turn keeps the GBP/USD buyers hopeful amid steady RSI. Adding strength to the upside bias is the quote’s successful trading beyond the 200-DMA. In addition to the 200-DMA support of around 1.1900, an upward-sloping trend line from early January, close to 1.1940 at the latest, also acts as the short-term key support for the GBP/USD pair. In a case where the GBP/USD remains bearish past 1.1900, lows marked during January 2023 and late November 2022, respectively near 1.1840 and 1.1760, will be in focus. On the flip side, a daily closing beyond the 50-DMA hurdle surrounding 1.2140 could quickly propel the Cable pair toward the mid-February swing high surrounding 1.2270. It’s worth noting, however, that the GBP/USD pair’s successful trading above 1.2270 enables the buyers to aim for the 2.5-month-old horizontal resistance area nearing 1.2445-50.

"AUD/USD prints mild losses around the mid-0.6700s as bulls take a breather following the first weekly gain in three during early Monday. In doing so, theAussiepair portrays the failure to cross the 50-bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Even so, the bullish MACD signals and the RSI (14) rebound keeps the AUD/USD buyers hopeful unless the quote breaks a three-day-old support line, around 0.6720. Following that, the monthly low near the 0.6700 round figure and the January 2023 low of 0.6687 can act as extra checks for the Aussie pair sellers before giving them control. Should the AUD/USD bears keep the reins past 0.6687, the last December’s bottom surrounding 0.6630 may gain the market’s attention. On the contrary, recovery moves need to cross the 50-EMA hurdle near 0.6775 to convince intraday buyers of the AUD/UDS pair. However, a convergence of the 100-EMA and a downward-sloping resistance line from early February, around 0.6820-25 by the press time, appears a tough nut to crack for the pair buyers. In a case where the AUD/USD bulls manage to keep the driver’s seat past 0.6825, the odds of witnessing a run-up toward the mid-February high of near 0.7030 can’t be ruled out. It should be noted that the 0.7000 round figure may act as a buffer between 0.6825 and 0.7030. AUD/USD: Daily chart  Trend: Limited downside expected Additional important levels  ",0
"China announced its annual growth target to be 5% – a relatively modest target that has left some disappointment in the market that Beijing chose to lowball its growthoutlookwith a target of 5%, rather than the 5.5%-plus favored. This is being widely taken as a signal that large-scale stimulus is unlikely. ''A challenging export environment and an ongoing correction in the property market are key headwinds this year,'' analysts at ANZ Bank said. Meanwhile, the Government Work Report is also likely to try to push measures to encourage foreign investment into the country and trade. There are also likely to be details of key changes to top-line officials. The session is lso set to hand President Xi Jinping a third term in office and implement the biggest government shake-up in a decade. “Global inflation remains high, global economic and trade growth is losing steam, and external attempts to suppress and contain China is escalating,” outgoing Premier Li Keqiang said during his speech to open the parliament, which will run through March 13.",1
"EUR/USD retreats to 1.0630, printing mild losses after a notable weekly positive closing, as sour sentiment joins mixed concerns about the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) next move. It’s worth noting that a light calendar in Asia also tests the pair traders amid a sluggish start to the key week. That said, hawkish ECB commentary gains support from the strong Eurozone inflation numbers. However, the US data fails to match its European counterpart and challenges the hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) concerns. European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council member Boštjan Vasle said in on Friday, “My personal expectation is that the increase we intend for our March meeting – that is 0.5 percentage points – will not be the last one.” On the same line, ECB Governing Council member Madis Muller said on Friday, “it is probably not the final hike in March.” However, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said, “Interest rate path after March will be data-dependent.” Earlier in the day, ECB President Christine Lagarde backed 50 basis points (bps) rate hike in March by citing inflation concerns. On the other hand, Federal Reserve Bank ofAtlanta President Raphael Bosticrenewed concerns about the Fed’s policy pivot as the decision-maker said, “The central bank could be in a position to pause the current tightening cycle by mid to late summer.” On the contrary, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said during the weekend that if data on inflation and the labor market continues to come in hotter than expected, interest rates will need to go higher, and stay there longer, than Fed policymakers projected in December, as reported by Reuters. Furthermore, US Federal Reserve published a semi-annual Monetary Policy Report on Friday wherein it clearly said, “Ongoing increases in the Fed funds rate target are necessary.” The report also stated that the Fed is strongly committed to getting inflation back to 2%. Talking about the data, Eurozone inflation numbers, namely theProducer Price Indexand the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) printed strong figures for February and hence authenticated theECBpolicymakers’ hawkish tone, which in turn allows the EUR/USD to remain firmer. The US data, however, fails to impressUS Dollardespite the first US Treasury bond yields, which in turn weigh on the Euro pair. That said, the US ISM Services PMI for February came in as 55.1 versus 54.5 market expectations and 55.2 market forecasts. Previously in that week, the US Durable Goods Orders for January eased while the Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence also flashed mostly downbeat details. Apart from the EU-US catalysts, headlines from China’s annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC) appear important and recently weigh on the risk profile, as well as the EUR/USD price. As per the latest update, the dragon nation eyes a modest growth of 5.0%, versus market expectations of 6.0%, for the current year. Furthermore, fears from China and Russia also probe the sentiment and weigh on the EUR/USD prices. Above all, the cautious mood ahead of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s half-yearly Testimony and the US employment report for February, as well as today’sEurozoneRetail Sales for February, restrict immediate moves ofthe EUR/USD pair. Adding importance to today's economic calendar is the US Factory Orders for January. Should the bloc’s data match upbeat expectations of 1.9% YoY, versus -2.8% prior, the quote may reverse the latest losses. Technical analysis Despite a sustained bounce off the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently around 1.0535, the EUR/USD rebound needs validation from the 1.0655-60 resistance confluence comprising 50-EMA and three-week-old resistance line to convince buyers.

"GBP/USD prints mild losses around 1.2030-35 during early Monday, consolidating the first weekly gains in three amid the market’s cautious mood ahead of the key catalysts, as well as fadingBrexitoptimism. Adding filters to the latest market moves could be the downbeat US Treasury yields, extending the previous week’s pullback from a multi-month high, as well as the minor losses of the USstockfutures. That said, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has urged the Government to stop “overselling” its new post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland and focus on providing clarity on its detail. The same shows the DUP’s dislike for the initial details of the EU-UK deal on the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP) and raises challenges for the smooth passage of the key Brexit developments in the UK Parliament. To avoid any hardships, the British government is bracing to provide more details on how Northern Irish lawmakers can potentially veto new European Union laws. ""Just to make sure that we get this exactly right, in the next few days, we're going to codify this,"" UK’s EU Minister Chris Heaton-Harris told BBC Radio Ulster, referring to the Stormont brake, per Reuters. Elsewhere, mixed headlines from China and a cautious mood ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s half-yearly Testimony, as well as the US employment report for February, seem to weigh on the GBP/USD price amid a sluggish start. Furthermore, the mixed performance of the US Treasury bond yield and the US stock futures also challenge the momentum traders even as the prices print mild losses. While portraying the mood, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose to the highest levels since November 2022 before easing to 3.95% at the latest. That said, Wall Street closed with gains but S&P 500 Futures remain indecisive, reversing the early-day losses, by the press time. Moving on, headlines surrounding Brexit and the second-tier UK data may entertain GBP/USD traders but major attention will be given to how Fed’s Powell could push back the policy pivot concerns. Also important will be to watch Friday’s monthly UK data dump for January and the USNonfarm Payrollsfor February. Given the recently downbeat US statistics, any more weakness in the headline figures could put a floor under the Cable price. Technical analysis A clear downside break of the one-month-old previous resistance line, now support around 1.2020, becomes necessary for the intraday sellers. Even so, the 1.2000 psychological magnet and the 200-DMA support of around 1.1900 could challenge the GBP/USD pair’s further downside. Alternatively, a daily closing beyond the 50-DMA hurdle surrounding 1.2140 could propel the Cable pair toward the mid-February swing high surrounding 1.2270. Additional important levels  ",0
"USD/JPY retreats to 135.80 as it reverses the bounce off intraday low amid a sluggish start to the key week. The Yen pair trader’s cautious mood ahead of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) monetary policy meeting and Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s half-yearly Testimony appears to be the key filters for the Yen pair. Also challenging the quote’s moves could be the latest inaction of the US Treasury bond yields, as well as the mixed signals from China. The US benchmark bond coupon, namely the 10-year Treasury bond yields, rose to the highest levels since November 2022 in the last week before easing to 3.95% by the end of Friday, making rounds to the same level at the latest. More importantly, the US two-year bond coupons rose to the highest levels last seen in 2008 before retreating to 4.85% by the press time. It’s worth noting that the receding optimism about the Fed’s hawkish moves, mixed US data, and the Fed policymakers’ failure to impress USD/JPY bulls seem to weigh on the yields of late. Furthermore, China’s expectations of modest growth for 2023 and the Sino-American tension are extra filters for traders. During the last week, the US ISM Services PMI for February came in as 55.1 versus 54.5 market expectations and 55.2 market forecasts. Previously in that week, the US Durable Goods Orders for January eased while the Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence also flashed mostly downbeat details. With this, Federal Reserve Bank ofAtlanta President Raphael Bosticrenewed concerns about the Fed’s policy pivot as the decision-maker said, “The central bank could be in a position to pause the current tightening cycle by mid to late summer.” However, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said during the weekend that if data on inflation and the labor market continues to come in hotter than expected, interest rates will need to go higher, and stay there longer, than Fed policymakers projected in December, as reported by Reuters. On the same line, US Federal Reserve published a semi-annual Monetary Policy Report on Friday: ""Ongoing increases in the Fed funds rate target are necessary.” The report also stated that the Fed is committed to reducing inflation to 2%. It’s worth noting that the BoJ officials and incoming board members have recently defended the Japanese central bank’s ultra-easy monetary policy, which puts a floor under the USD/JPY prices. Further, expectations that BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may play its last ball with all strength also keep the yen pair buyers hopeful despite the latest weakness in the quote. On the other hand, Fed’s Powell may have a tough time convincing markets amid pivot talks and mixed data. Even if he does, the USNonfarm Payrolls(NFP) will be watched closely for clear directions. Technical analysis The latest U-turn from the 100-DMA and the downside break of the one-month-old previous support line keep USD/JPY sellers hopeful.

It’s worth noting that the Aussie pair marked the first weekly gain in three amid broadUS Dollarweakness in the last week. That said, the recent positive headlines from China, after an initial disappointment, seem to help the Aussie pair of late. After showing an initial disappointment from China’s downbeat growth forecasts, following the softer economic figures in decades, the AUD/USD pair buyers cheer the latest headlines from the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China (NDRC). “Will further release the potential for consumption,” said NDRC while also adding that China's economy steadily improving, per Reuters. Meanwhile, softer prints of Australia’s TD Securities Inflation for February, 6.3% YoY versus 6.4% prior, seemed to have also probed theAussiepair buyers earlier in the day. During the weekend, headlines from China’s annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC) appeared grim and weighed on the risk profile early Monday. The NPC expected a modest growth of 5.0%, versus market expectations of 6.0%, for the current year. Apart from the softerGross Domestic Product(GDP) expectations, geopolitical concerns were also discussed and the same challenged AUD/USD buyers. “China should promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and advance the process of China's ""peaceful reunification"", but also take resolute steps to oppose Taiwan independence,” said outgoing China Premier Li Keqiang. Looking further back, softer prints of the US data and mixed Fed talks joined the US Treasury bond yields’ retreat from the multi-month high to recall the AUD/USD buyers, following a two-week losing streak.

"EUR/USD rebound pokes the 100-SMA hurdle around 1.0650 heading into Monday’s European session. The major currency pair recovered from a two-month low in the last week on broadUS Dollarweakness, as well as the hawkish concerns about the European Central Bank (ECB). However, the cautious mood ahead of the top-tier catalysts from the US and Europe seems to test the momentum traders of late. Also read:EUR/USD grinds lower towards 1.0600 ahead of Eurozone Retail Sales, focus on Fed Chair Powell, US NFP That said, a one-month-old descending resistance line, near 1.0660 by the press time, acts as an extra filter towards the north, apart from the immediate 100-SMA hurdle of 1.0650. It’s worth noting that the EUR/USD pair’s run-up beyond the 1.0650 hurdle isn’t an open invitation for the quote’s rally as the 200-SMA and a two-month-long horizontal resistance area could check the pair’s further upside, respectively near 1.0745 and 1.0760-65. Shouldthe EUR/USD pairportray another defeat from the key SMA hurdle, a one-week-old ascending support line near 1.0600 will be crucial to watch as it holds the gate for the pair’s slump toward early 2023 low near 1.0480. Adding strength to the 1.0480 support is November 2022’s top. In a case where EUR/USD drops below 1.0480, the late November low near 1.0290 and the monthly bottom of 1.0222 will be in focus.

"The GBP/USD pair struggles to capitalize on Friday's goodish rebound from a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and kicks off the new week on a subdued note. The pair, however, manages to hold comfortably above the 1.2000 psychological mark through the Asian session amid a mildly softer tone surrounding theUS Dollar. The ongoing retracement slide in the US Treasury bond yields weighs on the USD bulls on the defensive, which, in turn, lends some support to the GBP/USD pair. That said, a combination of factors acts as a tailwind for the Greenback and keeps a lid on any meaningful upside for the major, warranting caution for aggressive bullish traders. Growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve tighten its monetary policy further to tame stubbornly high inflation, along with looming recession risks, helps limit the downside for the USD. In fact, the US macro data released recently indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped and pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs. This should allow the Fed to stick to its hawkish stance for longer. Adding to this, a slew of FOMC members backed the case for higher rate hikes and opened the door for a 50 bps lift-off at the March policy meeting. This should help limit the downside for the US bond yields and supports prospects for the emergence of some USD dip-buying. Apart from this, anxiety over the new UK-UKBrexitdeal on the Northern Ireland Protocol is holding back traders from placing bullish bets around theBritish Poundand contributing to capping the GBP/USD pair. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) remains concerned over key aspects of the agreement and appears split since the Windsor Framework was announced last Monday. In fact, the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson refused to oppose it outrighteven as senior MPs strongly criticised the agreement. The price action, meanwhile, indicates that an additional rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) is already fully priced in the markets. Moreover, some analysts still hope that the UK central bank would pause the current tightening cycle, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the downside. Hence, any meaningful upside remains elusive ahead of this week's key event/data risks - the Fed Chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony, the monthly UK GDP print and theUS NFPreport.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Last Friday, we expected AUD to trade sideways between 0.6700 and 0.6760. While AUD rose to 0.6775, there is no marked improvement in upward momentum. Today, AUD is unlikely to advance much further. Instead, AUD is more likely to trade between 0.6735 and 0.6780.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have a negative AUD view since the middle of last month.

In NY trade, AUD rose to a high of 0.6775. While our ‘strong resistance’ level at 0.6800 is not breached, downward momentum has more or less fizzed out. In other words, the weak phase in AUD has ended.

"TheUSD/JPY pairremains under some selling pressure for the second successive day on Monday and moves further away from the YTD peak, around the 137.10 region touched last week. The pair, however, recovers a few pips from the daily low and trades just above mid-135.00s during the early European session, down around 0.20% for the day. TheUS Dollarkicks off the new week on a subdued note amid a modest downtick in the US Treasury bond yields and turns out to be a key factor weighing on the USD/JPY pair lower. Apart from this, looming recession risks seem to benefit the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and contribute to the offered tone surrounding the major. Worries about a deeper global economic downturn resurfaced after China set a lower-than-expected target for economic growth andforecastthat the economy would expand by 5% in 2023. The downside for the USD/JPY pair, meanwhile, seems cushioned amid the divergent Bank of Japan-Federal Reserve monetary policy outlook. In fact,  the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda stressed the need to maintain the ultra-loose policy to support the fragile economy and said last week that the central bank isn't seeking a quick move away from a decade of massive easing. In contrast, the US central bank is universally expected to stick to its hawkish stance and keep rates higher for longer to tame high inflation. The incoming US macro data indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped and pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs. Adding to this, a slew of FOMC members backed the case for higher rate hikes and opened the door for a 50 bps lift-off at the March policy meeting.  This should act as a tailwind for the US bond yields and favours the USD bulls, which supports prospects for the emergence of dip-buying around the USD/JPY and warrants caution for bears. Traders might also prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of this week's key event/data risks, starting with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors will look for fresh clues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics.

Today, USD could edge lower but a sustained decline below 135.50 is unlikely. On the upside, a breach of 136.45 would suggest the current mild downward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Last Friday (03 Mar, spot at 136.65), we indicated that while theoutlookfor USD is still positive, the major resistance at 137.90 could be out of reach this time around.

"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will announce its next monetary policy decision on Tuesday, March 7 at 03:30 GMT and as we get closer to the release time, here are the forecasts by the economists and researchers of 9 major banks regarding the upcoming central bank's decision. The RBA is set to deliver another 25 basis points rate hike in March, lifting the Official Cash Rate (OCR) from 3.35% to 3.60%. The focus will be on the March statement for any changes in the central bank’s language, with regard to the wage and rate hikeoutlook. ING “We expect that the upcoming RBA meeting is going to be much more interesting than has been the case recently. The RBA will want to see confirmation of a downward trend in inflation, not just a reversal of seasonal spikes to even consider pausing its current 25 bps per meeting tightening strategy. The softer-than-expected 4Q22 GDP number was encouraging but we would need to see confirmation from other data to conclude that a slowdown is underway, and of a sufficient magnitude to see inflation fall back within the RBA’s 2-3% target range.” ANZ “While the weak wages resultraisesthe risk the RBA may feel able to pause in its tightening cycle earlier than we currently think, we still expect another 25 bps hike. The nascent recovery in housing prices would suggest that rate hikes have not yet quelled demand enough to be confident that inflation will move back into the target band in a reasonable time frame. We’ll be watching the post-meeting statement for the RBA’s take on the wages data. The Board’s interpretation of the wages data will give us a guide on what might be ahead.” Westpac “We expect the Board will decide to lift the cash rate by a further 0.25% from 3.35% to 3.6%. We would be very surprised if the Board decided to pause in March. A further hike in April, which is Westpac’s view, seems the logical extension of the February statement. Any policy change to take the recent data into account should be contemplated for May.” Standard Chartered “We expect a 25 bps hike to 3.60%. We recently revised the terminal rate to 4.10% from 3.50% previously. Specifically, we expect the central bank to hike by 25 bps each in March, April and May. Trimmed mean CPI inflation eased to 1.7% QoQ in Q4-2022 from 1.9% QoQ in Q3 – still far too high. Inflation pressures are also still very broad – we estimate that 84% of items in the CPI basket are rising by more than 3% YoY. These factors raise risks of a 50 bps hike in March.” TDS “The focus will be on whether the RBA softens its language in light of recent weaker data. On the back of the widening breadth and persistence of inflation, the cash rate in Australia remaining below comparable G10 economies, and the Australian economy more likely to benefit from China's reopening, we expect the RBA to push on with hikes in Apr and May.” Nomura “We expect the RBA governor’s press release to: i) announce a 25 bps hike; ii) contain mixed macro comments; and iii) provide less hawkish forward guidance.” SocGen “We believe that recent signs in the macroeconomic data, such as the decline in inflation, the rebound in unemployment rate, relatively lukewarm wages growth and the confirmation of consumption slowdown all support a 25 bps hike in March. They also support our base scenario of a terminal policy rate at 3.85%, despite the financial market’s more hawkish expectation on US Fed policy.” Citibank “We expect RBA to increase the cash rate by 25 bps to 3.60%. This would be the highest since May 2012 and take monetary policy further into restrictive territory. Citi’s mid-point estimate of neutral is ~ 2.85%.” Wells Fargo “We expect the RBA to raise its policy rate by 25 bps to 3.60%, while we also expect a final 25 bps rate hike to 3.85% in April. There could also be interest in this meeting as to whether theRBAhints at any possibility that rate hikes might continue beyond April as well.”",0
"BoJ will meet Friday with a consensus of no change. Economists at MUFG Bank expect theUSD/JPY pairto struggle to enjoy gains.

The Diet is likely to confirm the nominees next Friday as well and of course, we have theNFP datafrom the US.” “Assuming no surprise, USD/JPY will continue to take its lead from US yields and hence the jobs data will be key. But YCC speculation is unlikely to subside and given the dysfunctional JGB market conditions we see strong justification for an end to YCC possibly at the 16th June policy meeting.” “In those circumstances, we see limited scope to the upside for USD/JPY, especially given the upside for US yields should also become more limited from here after the surge in yields in February.” ",0

Meanwhile, US Treasury bond yields, which underpinned the USD last week’s price action, are down, with the 10-year benchmark note rate below 4%, at 3.950%. The week could be volatile due to US Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s appearance at the US Congress on March 7 and 8.

He’s expected to reiterate that interest rates must go higher for longer if the US economy continues to print solid data. Following astonishing January data, the USNonfarm Payrollsfigures are awaited on Friday. Market participants estimate the US economy added 200K jobs to the economy.

It is part of the shifting winds as traders look for more certain direction. Those MAs are short term barometers.  Trade below and traders look toward the lower targets. Move above and they look for the higher targets. Traders hope the 100/200 hour MA prove some momentum in the direction of the break, but ultimately, the price will need to make a break below 1.1914, or above the 1.21469 to get the pair out of the quagmire. Until then, the interim levels between those extremes will be explored, tested, broken or not broken. So follow the targets. Try to trade near them. If the momentum in the direction of the break increases, look toward the next targets. If the break and momentum fails, get out and recognize the shifts in the bias.",1

Despite a softUS Dollarat the start of the day as investors awaited testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell andNonfarm Payrolls, GBP stayed pressured as central bank divergences play out. The Federal Reserve may keep raising interest rates into June while theBank of Englandcould soon pause policy tightening while the BOE may only have 25bp more of tightening left to do. Key survey data suggest tightness in the UK labour market is abating and theGross Domestic Productis up next for review. Analysts at TD Securities argued that it is set to bounce back sharply as many of the special factors that weighed on the December data will reverse. ''A downtick in strike action, a jump in hospital visits, the resumption of the Premier League after the end of the World Cup, and a bounce-back in school attendance likely drove a 0.7% m/m increase in services output. Underlying growth dynamics likely remained weak though,'' the analysts argued. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday will be a driver for the US Dollar as will the jobs report. The analysts at Danske Bank are expecting growth to moderate to 220k after the effects of warm weather and heavy seasonal adjustments in January faded.

"Here is what you need to know on Tuesday, March 7: A quiet beginning for a busy week. Wall Street trimmed gains late on Monday to post a mixed close. TheUS Dollaralso finished with mixed results, as market participants await new guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that will testify before the US Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. Also, US job numbers are on the radar (ADP on Wednesday, Jobless Claims on Thursday and NFP on Friday). The DXY lost 0.15%, falling below 104.50. The Euro was among the top performers supported by higher Eurozone bond yields following hawkish comments from European Central Bank (ECB) officials.

"The AUD/USD pair has stretched its recovery above 0.6730 in the early Asian session. TheAussieasset is looking to add gains further as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will announce theinterest rate decision. The RBA is expected to continue its policy tightening spell further to sharpen its monetary tools in the battle against soaring inflation. Last week, the Australian monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) softened significantly to 7.4% for January from the multi-decade high of 8.4%. Australian inflation has remained highly sticky and has not reacted as expected to the higher rates by the RBA. Therefore, RBAGovernor Philip Loweis expected to restrict monetary policy further in achieving price stability. Analysts at Standard Chartered are of the view that “A 25 bps hike to 3.60%. We recently revised the terminal rate to 4.10% from 3.50% previously. Specifically, the central bank is to hike by 25 bps each in March, April, and May. Trimmed mean CPI inflation eased to 1.7% QoQ in Q4-2022 from 1.9% QoQ in Q3 – still far too high. Inflation pressures are also very broad – we estimate that 84% of items in the CPI basket are rising by more than 3% YoY. These factors raise risks of a 50 bps hike in March.” The USDollar Index(DXY) has sensed barricades around 104.40 and is continuing its downside move toward the critical support of 104.10. S&P500 futures have added some gains in the early Asian session after a choppy Monday, portraying an improvement in therisk appetiteof the market participants. The 10-year US Treasury yields look set to reclaim the 4% figure ahead. Going forward, the US Dollar will dance to the tunes of the United States Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment Change (Feb) data, which will release on Wednesday. The economic data is expected to improve to 195K, lower than the former released of 105K. US Labor market data could be resilient as consumer spending has remained solid in February, which could propel the demand for more talent to address fresh demand for goods and services.

The greenback registered losses, of 0.22%, at 104.292. Contrary to UST bond yields. The 10-year benchmark note rate finished almost unchanged but in positive territory at 3.966%. On March 7thand 8th, the Chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, is scheduled to testify before the US Congress. Market participants anticipate that he will give a speech reaffirming the Fed’s dedication to controlling inflation and keeping interest rates elevated for a certain period. However, analysts predict that if asked about the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) peak, Chair Powell may not provide a specific answer. On the Japanese front, the upcoming policy meeting of the Bank of Japan (BoJ), scheduled for March 10th, would be Governor Kuroda’s final meeting. The markets believe he will use this opportunity to initiate policy normalization by adjusting the Yield Curve Control (YCC). Rabobank analysts commented that the BoJ would take a cautious approach to loosen conditions of the YCC, and it would be the first step towards monetary policy normalizations. What to watch?

"The trade balance released by theAustralian Bureau of Statisticsis out as follows: AUD/USD update Unchanged at 0.6730 and flat on the day ahead of the Reserve Bank of AustraliaRBAand the Federal Reserve's chairman testimony to Congress. A 25bp hike is an overwhelming consensus for today's RBA. ''The focus will be on any changes to last month’s statement that “the Board expects that further increases in interest rates will be needed over the months ahead”. We’ll also be looking for the RBA’s take on thesofter Q4 wage printsand whether these alter its view on the risk of a “price-wage spiral”. But the recent run of softer data won’t be enough to dispel the RBA’s concern that inflation expectations could become entrenched,'' the analysts at ANZ Bank said. About the Trade Balance The trade balance released by theAustralian Bureau of Statisticsis the difference in the value of its imports and exports of Australian goods. Export data can give an important reflection of Australian growth, while imports provide an indication of domestic demand. Trade Balance gives an early indication of the net export performance. If a steady demand in exchange for Australian exports is seen, that would turn into a positive growth in the trade balance, and that should be positive for the AUD.",0
"AUD/USD prints mild gains to consolidate the week-start losses around 0.6730-35 during early Tuesday. In doing so, theAussiepair cheers positives from the Australian Exports and Imports while paying a little heed to the downbeat trade surplus. It’s worth noting that the quote remains dicey so far during the day as traders await the key Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announcements, as well as the key Testimony from Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell. Australia’s January monthly Trade Balance came in 11,688M versus 12,500M market forecasts and 12,237M previous readings. The details suggest that the Exports reversed the previous -1.0% with 1.0% growth while Imports rose 5.0% from 1.0% previous readings. In addition to the upbeat Exports and Imports, comments from Aussie Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also seemed to have teased the AUD/USD buyers after a downbeat start to the key week. That said, Australia PM Albanese said earlier in the day, “I believe Australia can avoid a recession.” The policymaker also said that the relationship with China has improved. Elsewhere, dicey markets ahead of the keyRBAand Fed Chair Powell’s announcements join the fears emanating from the likely Sino-American tension, due to the anticipated meeting of the US and Taiwanese Officials, which seem to weigh on the AUD/USD pair. It should be observed that softer prints of the second-tier US data, including ISM PMIs, Consumer Confidence and Durable Goods Orders joined comments from AtlantaFed President Raphael Bosticto renew concerns about the policy pivot and weighed on the DXY in the last week, which in turn favored the AUD/USD bulls. Amid these plays, US 10-year Treasury bond yields initially dropped to a one-week low of 3.897% on Monday before ending the day with mild gains near 3.96%, staying around the same level by the press time. On the same line, the two-year counterpart ended Monday’s North American trading session with 0.60% intraday gains at 4.88%, mostly unchanged at the latest. That said, Wall Street closed mixed and the S&P 500 Futures also struggle for clear directions. Looking forward, AUD/USD traders may witness disappointment from the RBA if the central bank teases the policy pivot, which is highly expected. As per the market forecasts, the Aussie central bank is up for the likely last 0.25% rate hike during today’s monetary policy meeting.

"EUR/USD struggles for clear directions as it retreats from its intraday high to 1.0680 during the mid-Asian session on Tuesday. The major pair cheered the broad US Dollar weakness in the last two days to poke the highest levels in a fortnight. However, the cautious mood ahead of this week’s top-tier events seems to challenge the bulls of late. Apart from the broad US Dollar weakness, hawkish comments from the European Central Bank (ECB) officials also allowedthe EUR/USD pairto remain firmer. It’s worth noting that softer data at home contrasts with an improvement in the US statistics to probe the pair’s upside momentum and challenge the immediate moves. That said, USDollar Index(DXY) prints mild gains around 104.40 to snap a two-day downtrend. In doing so, the greenback’s gauge versus the six major currencies traces the recent rebound in the US Treasury bond yields. US 10-year Treasury bond yields initially dropped to a one-week low of 3.897% on Monday before ending the day with mild gains near 3.96%, staying around the same level by the press time. On the same line, the two-year counterpart ended Monday’s North American trading session with 0.60% intraday gains at 4.88%, mostly unchanged at the latest. Talking about the data, theEurozoneSentix Investor Confidence index worsens to -11.1 in March from -8.0 in February and -8.6 expected. Further, the Current Situation in the Eurozone improved to -9.3 during the stated month, from -10.0 prior, whereas the Expectations Index tumbled to -13.0 from -6.0 in February. EurozoneRetail Salesgrew by 0.3% MoM in February versus 1.0% expected and -1.6% prior while the YoY figures suggest the bloc’sRetail Salesarrived at -2.3% in February versus -2.8% seen in January and the 1.9% consensusforecast, per the official figures released by Eurostat showed on Monday. On the other hand, US Factory Orders improved to -1.6% MoM in January versus -1.8% expected and -1.7% prior. It should be observed thatECB President Lagardetold Spanish media group Vocento, per Reuters, “Underlying inflation in the Eurozone will stay high in the near term so a 50 basis point European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate increase later this month is increasingly certain.” However, when asked about a possible 50 basis points (bps) rate hike in March, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Centeno said that “the decision must be based on data.” Adding that the “interest rates have risen too fast.” Elsewhere, the fears emanating from the likely Sino-American tension, due to the anticipated meeting of the US and Taiwanese Officials, join recent doubts about the Fed’s hawkish move to challenge the traders ahead of the key event. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed mixed and the S&P 500 Futures also struggle for clear directions. Moving ahead, Fed Chair Powell’s testimony will be crucial to watch for the EUR/USD pair traders. Fed’s Powell appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and should defend the US central bank’s hawkish bias to recall the bears. Technical analysis Although the EUR/USD pair aptly portrays a clear bounce off the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), around 1.0540 by the press time, the pair’s upside moves appear elusive unless crossing the mid-January swing low surrounding 1.0766.

"The GBP/USD pair is displaying a lackluster performance in an extremely narrow range around 1.2020 in the Asian session. The Cable has been gyrating in a range of 1.2000-1.2050 from Monday as investors look more interested in going gung-ho for building positions after Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell’s testimony. S&P500 futures have added some gains after a directionless Monday, portraying a minor optimism among the market participants. The USDollar Index(DXY) is displaying a subdued performance as investors are awaiting Fed Powell’s testimony for further impetus. The return provided on 10-year US Treasury bonds has dropped marginally to 3.97%. The street has a mixed response to Fed Powell’s testimony. One school of thought is of the view that Fed Powell won’t endorse more rates as January’s upbeat consumer spending might not continue ahead. Higher interest rates by the Fed have critically made the United States economy vulnerable. However, the other school of thought believes that the Fed will deliver a hawkish stance as the battle against persistent inflation is well complicated yet. Apart from that, labor market data will be the key eventthis week. Wednesday’s US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment data is seen at 195K, higher than the prior release of 105K. Strong demand for labor could propel the fears of more rates from the Fed. And, could spurt fears of a recession in the US economy. On the Pound Sterling front, Friday’s data will be keenly focused.

Resolute in its determination to return inflation to target. Board expects that further tightening of monetary policy will be needed. The monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked in Australia. Services price inflation remains high, with strong demand for some services over the summer. Board is seeking to return inflation to the  2–3  per cent target range while keeping the economy on an even keel, but the path to achieving a soft landing remains a narrow one Growth in the australian economy has slowed. There is uncertainty around the timing and extent of the slowdown in household spending. Household consumption growth has slowed due to the tighter financial conditions. Uncertainties mean that there are a range of potential scenarios for the Australian economy. Labour market remains very tight, although conditions have eased a little. Wages growth is continuing to pick up in response to the tight labour market and higher inflation. Recent data suggest a lower risk of a cycle in which prices and wages chase one another. Board, however, remains alert to the risk of a prices-wages spiral, given the limited spare capacity in the economy and the historically low rate of unemployment.

"EUR/USD is an inch far from the round-level resistance of 1.0700 after a gradual move from 1.0680 in the Asian session. The major currency pair has been strengthened as investors’risk appetitehas improved. Investors have shrugged off recession risks associated with the United States economy due to higher rates from the Federal Reserve (Fed). The USDollar Index(DXY) looks vulnerable above the 104.20 support. The downside in the USD Index seems favored amid a decline in safe-haven’s appeal. S&P500 futures have added decent gains in the Asian session after Monday’s sideways auction, portraying positivemarket sentiment. An improved risk appetite has supported demand for US government bonds. This has resulted in a decline in the 10-year US Treasury yields to 3.96%. The Euro has been provided significant bids as investors are expecting more rate hikes from the European Central Bank (ECB) amid renewed fears of higher inflation in Eurozone. Fed Powell’s testimony to provide interest rate guidance Resilience observed in the United States through January’s consumer spending indicated that the Federal Reserve will continue hiking rates. Achieving price stability is the foremost agenda of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and for that more rates are highly required to tame sticky inflation. However, modest dovish commentary from Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller has trimmed fears of hawkish guidance. Fed Waller cited February’s inflation recovery as a one-time blip and the price pressures will resume their downtrend from next month. Meanwhile, analysts at MUFG said “They don’t expect Fed Chair Jerome Powell to endorse that scale of further tightening” when the Fed chief takes to Capitol Hill to deliver his semi-annual testimony before Congress. Analysts further added that Fed Powell is more likely to “wait to assess further data in the coming months to see if the strength in activity and inflation is sustained before strongly committing to more rate hikes.” US labor market to lay ground for further Fed moves A power-pack action is expected from the US Dollarthis weekas investors will shift their focus to the Employment data after Federal Reserve Powell’s testimony. On Wednesday, the United States Automatic Data Processing (ADP) will report the Employment Change data. According to the estimates, the US economy has added fresh 195K payrolls in February, higher than the former release of 105K. Later this week, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will report theNonfarm Payrolls(NFP) and the Unemployment Rate data. Apart from that, Labor cost index data will be in the spotlight as higher earnings will propel consumer spending ahead. This could force the Fed to stretch its restrictive policy measures further. And, the US Dollar bulls will be in the beast mode. European Central Bank’s Centeno sounds contrary to renewed inflation fears Less-than-anticipated fall in the Eurozone’s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and standalone recovery in German, Spain, and France inflation have renewed the risk of inflationary pressures. It seems that the impact of lower energy prices is fading away andEurozonecould fall into an inflation spiral ahead. Citing inflation as ‘too high’, European Central Bank President ChristineLagardehas already announced that the central bank will push rates further by 50 bps in its March monetary policy meeting. However, ECB policymaker Mario Centeno looks a little diverged from the provided plan. When asked about a possible 50 basis points (bps) rate hike in March, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Centeno said that “the decision must be based on data.” Adding that the “interest rates have risen too fast.” EUR/USD technical outlook  EUR/USD is marching towards the supply zone placed in a range of 1.0698-1.0705 on an hourly scale. The major currency pair is expected to recapture the same considering the strength in the upside momentum. A bull cross, represented by the 20-and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 1.0674 and 1.0654 respectively, add to the upside filters. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates that the upside momentum is already active. EUR/USD  ",1

AUD/USD is showing a tad longer consolidation in the range of 0.6700-0.6784 on an hourly scale. The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6737 is acting as a major barricade for the Australian Dollar. A slippage by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) in the bearish range of 20.00-40.00 is indicating a downside momentum ahead. A downside move below March 01 low around 0.6700 will drag the Aussie toward December 07 low at 0.6669 and December 20 low at 0.6629. In an alternate scenario, a confident break above March 01 high at 0.6784 will send the asset toward the round-level resistance at 0.6800 followed by February 06 low at 0.6855.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected GBP to edge higher to 1.2070 yesterday. Our expectation did not materialize as GBP traded in a relatively quiet manner between 1.1998 and 1.2049. The price actions appear to be consolidative and today, GBP is likely to trade within a range of 1.1990/1.2060.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from yesterday (06 Mar, spot at 1.2035) is still valid.

"EUR/USDclimbed to its highest level in nearly two weeks at 1.0700 on Monday. But the pair could edge lower toward 1.06 today, in the view of economists at ING. European hawks in focus “Helping EUR/USD yesterday were comments from ECB ultra hawk, Robert Holzmann, that the ECB should deliver four more 50 bps rate hikes. ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane tried to calm things down by suggesting the ECB should not go onto autopilot after what should be a 50 bps hike this month. But the market is more sensitive to the hawks given the sticky inflation data.” “We do not see anyECBspeakers scheduled today. Powell's testimony should dominate today and might nudge EUR/USD back to the lower end of the 1.0600-1.0700 range.” ",0

Our view was not wrong as USD dropped to 135.36 before rebounding to end the day little changed at 135.91 (+0.04%). USD appears to have moved into a consolidation phase and it is likely to trade in a range of 135.60/136.35 today.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from yesterday (06 Mar, spot at 135.90) still stands.

"The GBP/USD pairstruggles to capitalize on its intraday positive move to a four-day peak and meets with a fresh supply near the 1.2065 region on Tuesday. Spot prices retreat to the lower end of the daily range, around the 1.2020-1.2015 region during the first half of the European session and remain at the mercy of the US Dollar price dynamics. A generally positive tone around the equity markets, along with retreating US Treasury bond yields, initially weighed on the safe-haven Greenback and offered some support to the GBP/USD pair. That said, looming recession risks continue to keep a lid on any optimistic move in the markets. Apart from this, the prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve act as a tailwind for the US bond yields, which, in turn, help limit the downside for the USD and cap the upside for the major, at least for the time being. Investors seem convinced that the US central bank will stick to its hawkish stance and keep interestrateshigher for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The bets were reaffirmed by the incoming US macro data, which indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped and pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs. Moreover, a slew of FOMC policymakers recently backed the case for higher rate hikes and opened the door for a 50 bps lift-off at the March meeting. Hence, the market focus will remain glued toFedChair Jerome Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors will look for clues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to the GBP/USD pair. In the meantime, anxiety over the new UK-EUBrexitdeal on the Northern Ireland Protocol further seems to hold back the bullish traders from placing fresh bets around the major. The price action, meanwhile, indicates that an additional rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) is already fully priced in the markets. Moreover, some analysts still hope that the UK central bank would pause the current tightening cycle. This, in turn, suggests that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the downside and any meaningful upside could be seen as a selling opportunity. That said, sustained weakness below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is needed to confirm a fresh bearish breakdown. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
"AUD is lower after RBA’s rate decision. However, Antje Praefcke, FX Analyst at Commerzbank, warrants caution about pricing an end to hiking cycling in Australia anytime soon. Market must focus on price and economic data for the time being “In principle, theRBAcontinues to sound hawkish. It raised the key interest rate by 25 bps to 3.60% and expects that the key rate will have to be raised further. In short, the interest rate cycle is not over yet, with the RBA making further action data dependent.” “But if the RBA's statement was restrictive, why did the AUD weaken as a result of the rate decision? The statement was seemingly not restrictive enough for the market, which is why it sold the AUD in an initial reaction. However, I would be cautious to bet on an end to the interest rate cycle in Australia anytime soon.” “Similar to other countries, while headline inflation is falling due to falling energy prices and base effects, upward pressure remains in many other areas, especially services and wages. As the RBA makes its further course of action data dependent, the market must and will continue to focus on price and economic data for the time being.” ",0

"TheAUD/USDpair attracts fresh selling in the vicinity of mid-0.6700s on Tuesday and drops to its lowest level since December 23 during the first half of the European session. The pair now seems to have found acceptance below the 0.6700 round-figure mark and seems vulnerable to prolonging its downward trajectory witnessed over the past month or so. The Australian Dollar weakens across the board in reaction to the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) signal that a pause in its 10-month rate-hiking cycle is on the way. The RBA earlier this Tuesday raised its overnight cash rate as expected by 25 bps to 3.6%, or the highest since June 2012. In the accompanying policy statement, the RBA changed a reference from “further increases in rates” to “further tightening of monetary policy” would be needed and boosted expectations for an eventual pause in the policy tightening. Adding to this, RBAGovernor Philip Lowewarned that the path to achieving a soft landing for the Australian economy remains a narrow one and fueled worries that the economy could suffer a recession over the next 24 months. This, along with the disappointing release of Australia's trade balance data, is seen weighing on the domestic currency and dragging the AUD/USD pair lower for the second successive day. Bulls, meanwhile, fail to gain any respite and seem rather unimpressed by a subdued US Dollar demand. A generally positive tone around the equity markets seems to undermine the safe-haven Greenback, though does little to benefit the risk-sensitive Aussie or lend any support to the AUD/USD pair. The latest leg down, meanwhile, confirms a fresh breakdown through over a one-week-old trading range support. Apart from this, growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will stick to its hawkish stance for longer favours the USD bulls and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the downside. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets and prefer to wait forFedChair Jerome Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony. Investors will look for fresh clues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to the AUD/USD pair.

"Swiss inflation for February surprised sharply to the upside. Thus, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is unlikely to end its hiking cycle or allow a significant depreciation of the Franc, economists at Commerzbank report. Inflation surprise from Switzerland “Consumer price inflation climbed to 3.4% in February. Core inflation too continued to rise to 2.4% compared with 2.2% before.” “In the light of recent inflation data theSNBis likely to hike its key rate once again with a renewed 50 bps step quite possible, accompanied by hawkish comments.” “The SNB will probably still want to prevent the Franc from weakening, so as to avoid creating additional inflation pressure. So if the CHF were to depreciate, the SNB would probably intervene on the FX market.” “Even if theECBis supporting EUR with its hawkish comments the SNB is likely to do similarly and hikeratesitself and deliver hawkish comments, as well as intervening against franc depreciation if necessary. That means that it is probably too early for a sustainable jump above parity in EUR/CHF.” ",1
"The USD/JPY pair continues with its struggle to gain any meaningful traction and extends its sideways consolidative price move for the second successive day on Tuesday. The pair is currently placed just below the 136.00 mark, nearly unchanged for the day, and remains well within the striking distance of the YTD peak, around the 137.10 region touched last Friday. The prospects for further policy tightening by theFedcontinue to act as a tailwind for the US Dollar (USD) and lend support to the USD/JPY pair. In fact, the markets seem convinced that the US central bank will stick to its hawkish stance and keeprateshigher for longer in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. The bets were lifted by the incoming US macro data, which indicated that inflation isn't coming down quite as fast as hoped and pointed to an economy that remains resilient despite rising borrowing costs. Adding to this, a slew of FOMC policymakers recently backed the case for higher rate hikes and opened the door for a 50 bps lift-off at the March meeting.  Hence, the market focus will remain glued to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, due later during the North American session. Investors will look for fresh clues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will influence the USD price dynamics and determine the next leg of a directional move for the USD/JPY pair. Heading into the key event risk, a modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields is holding back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and acting as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair. The downside, however, remains cushioned amid expectations that the Bank of Japan will maintain the ultra-loose policy settings to support the fragile domestic economy. In fact, the incomingBoJGovernor Kazuo Ueda said last week that the central bank isn't seeking a quick move away from a decade of massive easing. Hence, the BoJ monetary policy decision, scheduled to be announced on Friday, is unlikely to provide any respite to the JPY, suggesting that the path of least resistance for theUSD/JPY pairis to the upside. Investorsthis weekwill also confront the release of the closely-watched US monthly employment details, popularly known asNFP. In the meantime, looming recession risks could limit deeper losses for the JPY and keep a lid on any meaningful appreciating move for the major, at least for the time being.

"RBAraises the cash rate target (CRT) by 25 bps to 3.60% but hints at a pause as early as next meeting. The AUD enjoyed a terrific start to 2023, but enthusiasm has died down, economists at Société Générale report. More frustration for AUD after RBA “The RBA did not surprise and raised the CRT by 25 bps to 3.60%, as widely expected. The statement reiterated that further tightening will be needed to ensure that inflation returns to target and that this period of high inflation is only temporary. However, it also acknowledged that inflation has probably peaked and hinted at possible pause as soon as April.” “Our economists maintain their view for a peak at 3.85% in April, below the 4.05% implied by futures.” “AUD/USD is close to graphical support of 0.6680/0.6660 representing low of January and the 50% retracement from last October.

GBP/USD has seen a pullback toward the 200-Day Moving Average (DMA) at 1.1913. Economists at Société Générale note that risks are tilted to the downside. Neckline at 1.1840/1.1800 is a crucial support “The run of decent UK macro hasn’t rubbed off onGBP/USDand near-term risks remains skewed to the downside on the outlook for a widening of Fed/BoE policy spread.” “Cable continues to toil around the 200-DMA at 1.1913 and could be under threat if Powell and USNFPelicit fresh Dollar buyingthis week.” “The price action has turned idle denoting lack of clear direction.

"The GBP/USD paircomes under some renewed selling pressure following an early uptick to the 1.2065 area, or a multi-day top touched earlier this Tuesday and extends the downfall through the mid-European session. The pair slides back below the 1.2000 psychological mark in the last hour and is pressured by the emergence of fresh US Dollar buying. Growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will stick to its hawkish stance and keep interestrateshigher for longer turn out to be a key factor that continues to act as a tailwind for the USD. Apart from this, looming recession risks further seem to benefit the Greenback's relative safe-haven status amid some repositioning trade ahead ofFedChair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Looking at the broader picture, the two-way price moves witnessed over the past four weeks or so constitute the formation of a rectangle on the dailychart. The lower end of the trading band coincides with a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Bearish traders need to wait for a convincing break through the said support, currently pegged around the 1.1910 area, before placing fresh bets. The GBP/USD pair might then turn vulnerable to accelerate the fall towards retesting the YTD low, around the 1.1840 region touched in January. Some follow-through selling will complete a bearish double-top pattern formation near the 1.2445-1.2450 area and pave the way for deeper losses. The downward trajectory could eventually drag spot prices below the 1.1800 mark, towards the 1.1725 support zone. On the flip side, the daily swing high, around the 1.2065 area, now seems to act as an immediate barrier ahead of the 1.2100 mark. Any subsequent move-up could attract fresh sellers and remain capped near the 50-day SMA, around the 1.2135-1.2140 region. That said, a sustained strength beyond could lift the GBP/USD pair towards the 1.2200 mark en route to the February 14 peak, around the 1.2265-1.2270 zone.

This could seal another increase in the policy rate of 50 bps at the meeting in two weeks. The headline rate was unchanged at 3.2% YoY but core CPI drifted up to a new high of 2.4% from 2.2%.” “Currently, a pullback is taking shape however 50-DMA at 0.9920 should be first support.” “In case the pair overcomes 1.0040, the bounce could extend towards January high of 1.0100 and 1.0220.” “Only if recent low at 0.9840/0.9830 gets violated would there be a risk of a deeper downtrend.” ",0
"TheAUD/USDpair comes under intense selling pressure on Tuesday and drops to its lowest level since late December heading into the North American session. The pair is currently placed around the 0.66600.6665 region, down nearly 1% for the day, and seems vulnerable to decline further. The Australian Dollar is turning out to be the worst-performing G10 currency amid a dovish assessment of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) policy statement, which, along with renewed US Dollar buying, exerts heavy pressure on the AUD/USD pair. In fact, the Australian central bank earlier this Tuesday raised its cash rate to the highest level since June 2012, though signalled that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle. The speculations were fueled by the accompanying policy statement, wherein theRBAchanged a reference from “further increases in rates” to “further tightening of monetary policy” would be needed. In contrast, the Federal Reserve is universally expected to stick to its hawkish stance and keep interestrateshigher for longer to tame stubbornly high inflation. This, in turn, continues to act as a tailwind for the Greeback, which further contributes to the heavily offered tone surrounding the AUD/USD pair. The steep intraday decline, meanwhile, confirms a breakdown below a one-week-old trading range support, around the 0.6690 zone, and further aggravates the bearish pressure. This, along with China's more conservativeoutlookfor 2023 GDP growth, suggests that the path of least resistance for the China-proxy Aussie is to the downside. Bearish traders, however, might take a breather and refrain from placing fresh bets ahead ofFedChair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, due later during the North American session. Investors will look for fresh cues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and determine the next leg of a directional move for the AUD/USD pair.

"Risk assets are under immense pressure on Tuesday which is weighing on the high beta currencies such as the Australian Dollar. AUD is down a whopping 2% on the day after dropping like a stone from 0.6661 US session highs to a low of 0.6591 thus far vs. the US Dollar, the lowest since Nov. 22. AUD/USD's high for the day, however, was up at 0.6747 before markets started to position for possible hawkish rhetoric from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress in US trade. Hawkish rhetoric was what the market's got and stubborn investors holding their bets against the US Dollar were taken to the cleaners. The DXY index, a measure of the US Dollar vs. a basket of currencies, vaulted 105 the figure in a move that started out from 104.43 and kept going until 105.435. The trigger? Reserve Bank of Australia and Federal Reserve divergence In recent trade, Federal Reserve's chair Jerome Powell said that the US central bank will stay the course until the job is done. However, Fed's Powell added that the ultimate level of interestratesis likely to be higher than previously anticipated. Federal Reserve'schairman Jerome Powellalso said that the Fed is prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes if data indicates it is warranted: ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Federal Reserve's chairman Jerome Powell's comments come after the bank slowed the pace of its tightening to 25 basis points at its last two meetings, following larger hikes last year. Fed funds futures traders have now raised bets that the Fed will hike rates by 50 basis points at its March 21-22 meeting to 56% and a 25 basis points increase is now seen as just a 44% likelihood. Traders are now also pricing for the rate to peak at 5.57% in September and the US Dollar is firmly bid as result. Meanwhile, prior to Federal Reserve's chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish testimony, the Reserve Bank of Australia,RBA, had already sawn the seed for a disparity between the Aussie and US Dollar. AUD was the weakest G10-performing currency due to what was perceived as a move towards a more dovish stance from the RBA at Tuesday's interest rate meeting. The Reserve Bank of Australia's policy-makers hiked interest rates by 25 bps. This was the 10th consecutive tightening but there was a switch up in the language which motivated the market to position for the possibility of a lower peak in rates which in turn weighed on AUD. The RBA has put down the foundations for a forthcoming pause in policy moves. ''In our view, the Fed is set to stick with its hawkish guidance for now suggesting that AUD/USD could remain on the back foot into the middle of the year,'' analysts at Rabobank said. ''That said, on a relative basis, the Australian economy remains fairly well positioned in terms of growth and we expect AUD/USD to pick up some ground in the latter part of the year,'' the analysts argued, adding that this forecast assumes that Fed rates have peaked by then. AUD/USD technical analysis Inprior AUD/USD analysis, it was explained that the downside scenario in a break of AUD/USD support opened risk to a test of the 0.6580s and then the 0.6520s:  AUD/USD update  AD/USD was coiled below the 200 DMA and on the break of support near 0.6700, the bears moved in and ground into 0.6650 orders that made way for a strong impulse down into the 0.6590s that guards the 0.6580s.

"EUR/USDkeeps falling as we move into late US trade in what has been a maximum drop in the single currency following uber-hawkish rhetoric from the Federal Reserve's chairman on Tuesday who testified to Congress. The main words that got the US Dollar going coming from the Fed's chair Powell were, ""the latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" As a consequence, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note rose to 4% before easing back to 3.96%, remaining marginally below the three-month high of 4.07% touched on March 2nd as investors assessed the pace of future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. This gave the greenback a boost. The DXY index, a measure of the US Dollar vs. a basket of currencies, vaulted 105 the figure in a move that started out from 104.43 and kept going until 105.435. Meanwhile, the Euro is likely to be hamstrung as Germany may still suffer a technical recession in Q4 2022/Q1 2023. However, analysts at Rabobank argued that ''at least more recent data are indicating resilience in the economy.'' On the other hand, the analysts also said, ‘resilient’ is not ‘strong’ and ''the market is facing these data releases with longer EUR positions than at the end of last year.  This suggests that the hawkish rhetoric of theECBmay struggle to coax the EUR significantly higher particularly given the recent buoyancy of the greenback.'' Of note, inflation remains stubbornly high in the Euro Area which was evident from the February inflation numbers. Officials, such as ECB's Pierre Wunsch indicated that it was not unreasonable to expect ECB to hike to 4%. ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said on Tuesday that the ECB can be expected to keep raising interestratesfor “quite some time” after March. Knot said that the current pace of hikes could continue into May if underlying inflation does not materially abate. “Once we see a clear, decisive turn in underlying inflation dynamics, I expect the ECB to move to smaller steps.” Knot also argued that inflation appears to have peaked. The sharp decrease in energy prices seen over the last months could bring down headline inflation even faster than what the ECB is projecting, the policymaker added. He does not see a recession in the winter and pointed out that the slowdown in economic growth seems “even more shallow, short-lived than expected”. EUR/USD    ",0
"The EURUSD has a 148 pip trading range now. That is well above the 22 day average of 80 pips (about a month of trading). Technically, the price cracked below both the 200 hour MA and trend line support at 1.0613 soon after the Fed Chair prepared remarks. There was a corrective move higher that retested that MA/underside of the broken trend line. Sellers leaned and pushed the pair lower. The swing area between 1.0576 to 1.0585 was broken as well with more momentum to the downside over the last 2-3 hours. The Low from March 1 was broken more recently. The low from last Monday is the next obvious target at 1.0532. Looking at the five minute chart below, the trend like move is more obvious.  Note the corrective move up to the 200 hour moving average that stalled the correction.  The legs to the downside have been able to stay below the 38.2-50% retracement. It would take a move above 1.0561 – 1.05662 hurt the trend move in the short term. Absent that in the sellers and the trend is still full steam ahead. Move above 1.0566 would take some of the steam out of the downside momentum, and we could see further corrective probing back to the upside as market traders take a breather. Yields moving higher continue to be a catalyst. The two-year note is above 5% at 5.008%. That's up 11.4 basis points. The two year yield has reached the highest level since 2007.

"AUD/USDholds lower grounds near 0.6585-80, the lowest levels since early November 2022, showing little reaction to Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe’s dovish remarks during early Wednesday. The reason could be linked to the previous day’s RBA statement that already revealed the dovish bias of the Aussie central bank, as well as the bear’s taking of a breather after posting the biggest daily slump in a month. RBA’s Lowe said on Wednesday that it was closer to pausing its aggressive cycle of rate increases as the policy was now in the restrictive territory and there were signs the economy was responding. Also read:RBA’s Lowe: Closer To Pausing On Rate Hikes On Tuesday,RBAmatched market forecasts of lifting the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.60%. The Aussie central bank even said that the RBA expects further monetary tightening will be needed. However, the RBA Statement said that the ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) indicator hints at the inflation peak and seemed to have weighed on the AUD/USD prices upon the announcements. More importantly, hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed)Chairman Jerome Powellin his Semi-Annual Testimony to the US Congress propelled the market’s risk-off mood, as well as the bets of a 50 bp Fed rate hike in March, which in turn drowned the AUD/USD prices. It’s worth noting that the fresh US-China tensions are an extra burden for the risk-barometer pair helping in weighing on the price at the multi-day low. The anticipated meeting of the US and Taiwanese Officials could be cited as the key reason for the same. On the same line, China’s new Foreign Minister, Qin Gang, said that they resolutely oppose all forms of hegemony, cold war mentality. The same indirectly criticizes the US pressure and criticism for the China-Russia ties and escalated the fears of a fresh round of Sino-American tensions. Further, Financial Times (FT) headlines suggesting China’s lowest growth target in decades signals a new era of caution. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed in the red and the US Treasury bond yields were firmer to underpin the US Dollar’s safe-haven demand, which in turn pleased the AUD/USD bears. Looking ahead, the second round of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the US ADP Employment Change, the early signal for Friday’s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) will be in focus. Also important to watch will be the risk catalysts surrounding China and the movements of the bond market.

"TheUSD/JPY pairhas scaled to near 137.40 in the early Asian session after an unusual upside move inspired by hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve (Fed) chairJerome Powellin his testimony before Congress. Fed’s Powell has endorsed moreratesciting inflation as extremely sticky considering the incoming data from the United States economy. Nominal gains have been recorded in the S&P500 futures after an intense sell-off on Tuesday, which could be minor short coverings amid a downbeat market mood. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) settled Tuesday’s session at a three-month high above 105.60 as the risk of recession in theUnited Stateseconomy has soared. The risk aversion theme has pushed the 10-year US Treasury yields above 3.98%. Fed’s Powell in his testimony before Congress unveiled a further roadmap for bringing down the sticky inflation. More interest rates are in pipeline as the current monetary policy is not restrictive enough to achieve price stability. According to the Fed Powell’s testimony, investors should be prepared for more rate hikes than earlier expected as economic indicators are conveying that inflationary pressures are extremely hot. Investors should be aware of the fact that this was the first commentary from Fed’s Powell on interest rates after observing resilience in consumer spending and an upbeat labor market through January’s economic data. Going forward, the release of the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment Change (Feb) data will be of utmost importance. The economic data is seen higher at 200K vs. the former release of 106K. On the Tokyo front, investors are keenly awaiting the last monetary policy dictation from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor HaruhikoKuroda, scheduled for Friday.

"The EUR/USD pairhas delivered a downside break of the consolidation around 1.0550 in the Asian session. It seems that the major currency pair has resumed its downside journey and is expected to deliver more losses amid negativemarket sentiment. The shared currency pair is expected to find a cushion around 1.0530. A dead cat bounce move by the S&P500 futures has faded as the risk-aversion theme is strengthening further. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has already pushed its upside to a three-month high above 105.60 and is expected to deliver gains amid a sheer improvement in safe-haven’s appeal. The 10-year US Treasury yields have scaled above 3.97%. Mounting recession fears in the United States economy after an extremely hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve (Fed) chairJerome Powellwhile testifying before Congress has strengthened the US Dollar. Fed’s Powell is considering moreratesas ‘fit and proper’ to scale down the red-hot inflation. He has confirmed that the current monetary policy is not restrictive enough to bring down inflation to desired levels. Consideration of a higher terminal rate than previously anticipated has stemmed from exceptionally higher payrolls reported in January. Earlier, Fed Governor Christopher Waller cited February’s economic data as a one-time blip and the price pressures will resume their downtrend from next month. Therefore, investors will get more clarity after the release of the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment Change (Feb) data, which is seen higher at 200K vs. the former release of 106K. On theEurozonefront, investors are shifting their focus toward German Retail Sales (Jan) data. The monthly data is expected to deliver an expansion by 2.0% vs. a contraction of 5.3% released earlier. This could propel inflationary pressures as a recovery in retail demand could trigger the German ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) ahead. European Central Bank(ECB) policymaker Klaas Knot said on Tuesday that the ECB can be expected to keep raising interest rates for “quite some time” after March. According to him, the current pace of hikes could continue into May if underlying inflation does not materially abate. EUR/USD  ",0
"GBP/USD struggles to defend the 1.1800 threshold at the lowest levels since late November 2022 even as the market turns dicey during early Wednesday. That said, the mixed plays surroundingBrexitand the Bank of England (BoE) seem to pushthe Cablepair towards making rounds to 1.1830-20 of late. “TheBank of Englandhas admitted that Brexit is making the City easier to regulate despite issuing warnings against the Government’s plan to axe swathes of red tape,” said The Telegraph. On the other hand, The Guardian highlights the push the British business leaders use over the UK government to fasten the Brexit practice, which in turn highlights the hopes of an end to the multi-month-old policy deadlock. “Business leaders say frayed relations with the EU are costing the British economy, as suppliers in the bloc grow more cautious about doing business with post-Brexit Britain,” said The Guardian. Elsewhere, Bank of England (BoE) policymaker Catherine Mann said on Tuesday, “I think more needs to be done withrates.” Above all, hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed)Chairman Jerome Powell, as well as the widest negative yield differentials between the 10-year and two-year US Treasury bonds, gain major attention the previous day and drowned the GBP/USD price. It should be noted that Fed’s Powell surprised markets by showing readiness for more rate hikes and bolstered the bets of a 50 bps Fed rate hike in March. The policymaker propelled the “higher for longer” Fed rate expectations and bolstered the US Treasury bond yields while weighing on theequities. Talking about the yields, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose 0.15% while closing around 3.97% on Tuesday but the two-year counterpart gained 2.60% on a day when poking the highest levels since 2007, to 5.02% at the latest. With this, the difference between the 10-year and two-year bond coupons marked the widest yield curve inversion in 40 years and portrays the recession, which in turn underpins the US Dollar’s safe-haven demand and weighs on the GBP/USD pair. On a different page, the US removal of testing restrictions on travelers from China contrasts with the US-China tussles over Taiwan and Russia to probe the sentiment. Even so, the S&P 500 Futures remain indecisive while waiting for more signals to track Wall Street’s losses. Looking ahead, a light calendar in the UK may restrict GBP/USD moves after a volatile day. However, Fed Chair Powell’s second round of testimony and the US ADP Employment Change, the early signal for Friday’s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), will be observed more closely for clear directions.

"USD/JPY buyers occupy the driver’s seat even as markets remain calm during early Wednesday, following a volatile end to Tuesday’s trading session. In doing so, the Yen pair makes rounds to the 137.40-50 area after rising to the highest levels since mid-December 2022. It should be noted that the Yen pair’s latest run-up could be linked to a successful upside break of the 100-DMA hurdle. However, the 200-DMA level surrounding 137.45-50 restricts the quote’s immediate upside amid the overbought conditions of the RSI (14). Even if the USD/JPY bulls manage to cross the stated key moving average, an upward-sloping resistance line from early February, near 138.35 by the press time, could challenge the pair’s further advances. In a case where the Yen pair bulls ignore the RSI conditions and keep the controls past the aforementioned resistance line, the 50%Fibonacciretracement level of its downturn from October 2022 to January 2023, near 139.60, may act as an additional upside filter. Meanwhile, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level and the 100-DMA, respectively near 136.70 and 136.25, restrict short-termUSD/JPYdownside.

S&P500 futures have surrendered their nominal losses earned in the early Asian session as the risk profile is getting depressed further. Mounting fears of a recession in the United States have triggered the risk-aversion theme. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has resumed its upside journey and has scaled to a fresh three-month high above 105.70. The alpha generated on 10-year US Treasury bonds has recaptured the 4.0% resistance. The remarks from RBAGovernor Philip Loweare impacting the Australian Dollar. RBA’s Lowe cited “The central bank is closer to pausing its aggressive cycle of rate increases as the policy is now in the restrictive territory and there are signs the economy was responding.” It seems that the slowdown in January’s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) has infused confidence in the sentiment of RBA’s Lowe. Apart from that, RBA’s Lowe believes that the reopening of the Chinese economy will positive for the Australian economy. It is worth noting that Australia is a leading trading partner of China and a gloomyeconomic outlookof china will support the Australian Dollar. Going forward, the US Dollar will be guided by the United States Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment Change (Feb) data. According to the estimates, the US economy has added fresh payrolls by 200K, higher than the former release of 106K. Later this week, the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data will provide more clarity.

" EUR/USDrenews a two-month low near 1.0525 as it extends the previous day’s south-run amid the widest yield curve inversion since 1981. It’s worth noting that the Euro pair slumped the most in more than a month the previous day on Federal Reserve (Fed) Jerome Powell’s hawkish rhetoric but a lack of major data/events seem to probe the bears of late, despite keeping them in the driver’s seat during early Wednesday. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Powell surprised traders by showing readiness for more rate hikes and bolstered the bets of a 50 bps Fed rate hike in March during the Semi-Annual Testimony before the US Congress. The policymaker propelled the “higher for longer” Fed rate expectations and bolstered the US Treasury bond yields while weighing on theequities. His comments propelled the yields and the US Dollar. It’s worth noting that the policymakers at theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) tried to defend their hawkish stance during public appearances but could not save the EUR/USD from renewing a two-month low. That said, ECB policymaker and Spanish central bank head Pablo Hernandez de Cos said on Tuesday, “Spain’s GDP forecast is anticipated to be revised up, while CPI is expected to fall.” On a broader front, ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said on Tuesday that the ECB can be expected to keep raising interestratesfor “quite some time” after March. Elsewhere, the US removal of the testing restrictions on travelers from China contrasts with the likely escalation of the Sino-American tensions surrounding Taiwan and Russia to weigh on the sentiment, as well as propel the US Dollar’s haven demand. However, a light calendar in Asia and cautious mood ahead of the key EU and US data/events seem to probe the EUR/USD traders even as the sellers refreshed a multi-day low recently. Amid these plays, the S&P 500 Futures remain indecisive around the 3,988 level after falling the most in two weeks the previous day. On the other hand, the difference between the 10-year and two-year US bond coupons marked the deepest yield curve inversion in more than 40 years the previous day, keeping it intact by the press time. It should be observed that the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rose 0.15% while closing around 3.97% on Tuesday but the two-year counterpart gained 2.60% on a day when poking the highest levels since 2007, to 5.02% at the latest. Looking forward, German Retail Sales for January, the second readings of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the fourth quarter (Q4) and Employment Change for the said period will precede the US ADP Employment Change for February to decorate the calendar.

" AUD/USDrecovers from a four-month low surrounding 0.6565 as it approaches the 0.6600 threshold heading into Wednesday’s European session, poking 0.6595 by the press time. In doing so, the Aussie pair bounce off a two-week-old descending support line while paring the biggest daily loss since February 03. Not only the downward-sloping support line from February 17 but the oversold RSI (14) also puts a floor under the AUD/USD price. The recovery moves, however, remain elusive as the previous support line from February 06, close to 0.6625 at the latest, guards the pair’s nearby upside. Following that, the 50-SMA hurdle surrounding 0.6725 can challenge the AUD/USD buyers. It should be noted that the upside break of 0.6725 isn’t an open invitation to the AUD/USD bulls as the monthly high near 0.6775 appears the key hurdle. Meanwhile, a downside break of the aforementioned support line, close to 0.6565 at the latest, could drag the Aussie prices towards the 0.6540-20 support zone as multiple levels marked in October 2022 might challenge the bears afterward. In a case where the AUD/USD pair remains bearish past 0.6520, the odds of witnessing a slump toward the previous yearly low surrounding 0.6170 can’t be ruled out.

While EUR could weaken further, any decline is unlikely to break the major support at 1.0485 today (there is another support at 1.0530). Any rebound is likely to stay below 1.0610 (minor resistance is at 1.0580).” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (07 Mar, spot at 1.0685), we highlighted that EUR appears poised to head higher towards 1.0750. We added, ‘On the downside, a breach of the ‘strong support’ level, currently at 1.0615, would indicate that the upside risk has faded’.

"The USD/JPY pair gains traction for the second straight day on Wednesday and climbs to its highest level since mid-December. The pair maintains its bid tone through the early European session and is currently placed around the 137.60 region, just above a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The overnight hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve ChairJerome Powellpushes the US Dollar to a three-month high, which, in turn, is seen acting as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. In the prepared remarks for his semi-annual congressional testimony, Powell indicated that interestratesmight need to go up faster and higher than previously anticipated. Powell added that the Fed is prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes to combat stubbornly high inflation and warned against prematurely loosening policy. This, in turn, lifts bets for a 50 bps rate hike at the March policy meeting and remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond is holding steady near the 4.0% threshold and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note stands tall near its highest level since 2007. This continues to lend support to the Greenback, which, along with expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will maintain the ultra-loose policy settings, is pushing the USD/JPY pair higher. It is worth recalling that the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda last week stressed the need to maintain the ultra-loose policy to support the fragile economy.  Ueda also said that the central bank isn't seeking a quick move away from a decade of massive easing. This marks a big divergence in comparison to the Fed's hawkish stance and supports prospects for a further appreciating move for the USD/JPY pair. That said, the risk-off mood benefits the JPY's safe-haven status and keeps a lid on any further gains for the major. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop seems tilted firmly in favour of bullish traders. Market participants now look forward to theUS economic docket, featuring the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment and JOLTS Job Openings data. Apart from this, Powell's second day of testimony before the House Financial Services Committee should influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to theUSD/JPY pair.

"UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang suggest further downside is likely inAUD/USDin the next few weeks. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “While we expected AUD to weaken yesterday, we were of the view that ‘any decline is expected to face solid support at 0.6695’. The anticipated support did not materialize as AUD nosedived to a low of 0.6580. The outsized decline appears to be overdone but AUD could drop to 0.6550 before stabilization is likely. The next support at 0.6500 is unlikely to come into view today. On the upside, any rebound is likely to stay below 0.6665 (minor resistance is at 0.6625).” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have expected AUD to consolidate between 0.6695 and 0.6820 since two days ago. Yesterday (07 Mar, spot at 0.6760), we highlighted that ‘Looking ahead, if AUD were to break and stay below 0.6695, it would suggest the weakness in AUD has resumed’. That said, we did not expect the outsized drop as AUD cracked several strong support levels and nosedived to a low of 0.6580. While the price actions suggest AUD is likely to weaken further, any weakness is likely to be at a slower pace, and the major support at 0.6500 may not come into view so soon. The downside risk is intact as long as AUD stays below 0.6700 (‘strong resistance’ level) in the next few days.”",0
"The GBP/USD pair consolidates the previous day's heavy losses and oscillates in a narrow band, just a few pips above its lowest level since November set earlier this Wednesday. The pair trades around the 1.1825 region during the first half of the European session and remains vulnerable below a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The US Dollar bulls take a breather following the recent strong run-up to a three-month top amid signs of stability in the equity markets. This, along with the extremely oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) on hourly charts, is seen lending some support to the GBP/USD pair. That said, any meaningful recovery still seems elusive amid rising bets for more aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the March FOMC policy meeting. The bets were lifted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Tuesday, indicating that interestratesmight need to go up faster and higher than previously anticipated. Powell further added that the Fed is prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes to combat stubbornly high inflation. The hawkishoutlookremains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields, which, along with looming recession risks, support prospects for a further near-term appreciating move for the safe-haven Greenback. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond holds steady around the 4.0% threshold and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note stands tall near its highest level since 2007. This adds to worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Apart from this, fading hopes over a strong Chinese economic recovery and US-China tensions should keep a lid on any optimism in the markets. Moreover, an additional rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) is already priced in, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the downside. Market participants now look to theUS economic docket, featuring the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment and JOLTS Job Openings data. This, along with the broader risk sentiment, Powell's second day of testimony before the House Financial Services Committee and the US bond yields, should influence the USD and provide some meaningful impetus tothe GBP/USD pair.

It could simply be end of week position squaring.  The trading price action on Monday is more important. Today, the price opened lower and back below the 200 hour MA. The price then moved back toward the 100 day MA at 0.67486 and the 100 hour MA (currently at 0.67449). The price dipped to 0.6741 and bounced. The Asian session high did extend back above the falling 200 hour MA, but momentum stalled. The price moved back below the key MA and stayed below this time. The subsequent fall through the European session has now seen the pair break below both the 100 day and 100 hour MAs (see both blue lines on the chart above). Those MAs come in at 0.67449 and 0.67486 respectively. They are now close risk levels. Stay below keeps the sellers in firm control. Move above, and the bias is back to the upside.

"Price action around the European currency remains subdued and promptsEUR/USDto navigate the lower end of the weekly range near 1.0540 on Wednesday. EUR/USD weaker post-Powell Following an earlier drop to new multi-week lows near 1.0520, EUR/USD manages to regain some balance and flirts with the 1.0550 region on the back of the persistent firm note in the greenback. The pair, in the meantime, seems to have met some temporary contention in the 1.0525/20 band following the Powell-induced sell off on Tuesday against the backdrop of renewed bets of a 50 bps rate hike by the Fed later in the month. On the latter, the US money market appears to confirm that change of expectations after the 2-year yield trade above the 5% threshold for the first time since June 2007. A deeper retracement in the pair, however, seems not favoured for the time being, as traders reduced markedly their open interest positions on Tuesday according to advanced data from CME Group for EUR futures markets.  In the domestic docket, another revision of the Q4 GDP Growth Rate now sees the EMU's economy flat QoQ and expanding 1.8% over the last twelve months.

What to look for around EUR EUR/USD plummeted to fresh 2-month lows on the back of the acute rebound in the greenback after investors shifted their expectations to a larger rate hike by the Fed at the March gathering In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, recession concerns now appear to have dwindled, which at the same time remain an important driver sustaining the ongoing recovery in the single currency as well as the hawkish narrative from the ECB.

"The AUD/USD pair stages a modest intraday recovery from a nearly four-month low touched earlier this Wednesday and builds on its steady intraday ascent through the first half of the European session. The pair climbs back above the 0.6600 mark and reverses a part of the previous day's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)-inspired losses, though the fundamental backdrop still seems tilted in favour of bearish traders. Against the backdrop of RBA's dovish shift on Tuesday, the prevalent strong bullish sentiment surrounding the US Dollar adds credence to the negativeoutlookfor the AUD/USD pair. It is worth recalling that the Australian central bank signalled that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle. In contrast, Federal Reserve ChairJerome Powellindicated that interestratesmight need to go up faster and higher than previously anticipated. In the prepared remarks for his semi-annual testimony to Congress, Powell added that the Fed is prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes to combat stubbornly high inflation. This, in turn, lifted bets for a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the March FOMC meeting and remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields. In fact, the rate-sensitive two-year US Treasury note jumps to its highest level since 2007 and pushes the USD to a three-month peak. Furthermore, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond holds steady near the 4.0% mark and fuels worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. This, along with fading optimism over a strong economic recovery in China and US-China tensions, continues to weigh on investors; sentiment and suggests that the path of least resistance for the risk-sensitive Aussie remains to the downside.

Our US economists do not exclude a rate peak at 6% if the data due for publication is sufficiently strong. The immediate rateoutlook, therefore, seems to offer further potential despite the renewed upside correction of the US Dollar.” “On the Euro side of things, the surprisingly strong fall in inflation expectations for the next three years in the monthly ECB consumer survey yesterday support the doves on the ECB board, thus limiting the upside in EUR/USD for now.” “The focus today will be on the number of job openings and the ADP employment report. This set of data is often used as a first indication of the labour market report, but it does not really reduce the potential for surprises as was illustrated impressively last month. In other words: of course today’s data can causevolatility, but only the labour market report on Friday will create sustainable momentum forEUR/USD.” ",1

"USD/JPYis flat near 137 the figure and within the day's range of between 136.47 and 137.91 while the greenback dips modestly from three-month highs reached earlier on Wednesday following Federal ReserveChairman Jerome Powellon Tuesday. TheUS Dollar index, DXY,  was reaching 105.88, the highest since Dec. 1 as the Fed chair surprised markets with a more hawkish rateoutlook. Powell said that the Fed will likely need to raise interestratesmore than expected in response to recent strong data and is prepared to move in larger steps if the ""totality"" of incoming information suggests tougher measures are needed to control inflation. This has led the Fed funds futures markets to price in a 66% probability of a 50 basis-point hike at the Fed’s March 21-22 meeting, up from around 22% before Powell spoke on Tuesday. The rate is now expected to peak at 5.62% in September. ''Looking ahead, 25 bp hikes in May and June are priced in that would take Fed Funds to 5.50-5.75%, with nearly 30% odds of a last 25 bp hike in Q3 that would move the range up to 5.75-6.0%,'' analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman said. ''After all this, an easing cycle is still expected to begin in Q4, albeit at much lower odds.  Eventually, it should be totally and unequivocally priced out into 2024 during the next stage of Fed repricing. For now, we believe the uptrends in US yields and the dollar remain intact,'' the analysts added. Looking ahead, investors are now focused on February jobs data in Nonfarm Payrolls that is due on Friday. Another 280k increase would be unambiguously strong following a 517k increase in January, analysts at Societe Generale said. ''There is room for potentially greater giveback on the January  increase, which was likely aided by warm weather. We see readings above a 150,000-175,000  threshold as strong, since over time such a pace would contribute to further declines in theunemployment rate.'' USD/JPY  ",0
"EUR/USDremains unchanged at 1.0545, below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as Fed Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the US Congress. Meanwhile, USequitiescontinued to fluctuate, portraying a mixed sentiment, while the US Dollar turned positive. At the time of writing, theEUR/USD is tradingat 1.0545. EUR/USD stays firm around familiar levels amidst the lack of a catalyst The EUR/USD has failed to gain traction either way after US economic data backed the latest commentaries by Jerome Powell. Although January’s JOLTs report showed a decrease In openings at 10.8M, it exceeded estimates of 10.5M. Earlier, the February US ADP Employment Change report revealed that the US private sector added 242,000 jobs, more than the expected 200,000. That said, figures from both reports reinforced what Federal Reserve officials have commented about a tight labor market, which would warrant further tightening by the Federal Reserve. That could weigh on the Euro (EUR); therefore, a further downside in the EUR/USD is expected. Before Wall Street opened, the Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin commented that inflation is still high and that the Fed stills have work to do. Later at the US House of Representatives, Fed Chief Jerome Powell said that the Fed had not decided yet about the upcoming March meeting. Powell added that China’s reopening could spur another round of inflation due to higher commodity prices. In the Euro area (EU),European Central Bank(ECB) policymakers have remained hawkish. Earlier in the week, ECB’s Knot said that the central bank needs to keep hiking rates for some time, echoing Robert Holzmann’s words to raise rates by 50 bps due to stubborn inflation. Ignazio Visco, ECB’s Governing Council (GC) member, commented that monetary policy must remain cautious and driven by economic data, favoring gradual rate increases. In the meantime, an ECB survey showed that EU consumers expect inflation to moderate and wages to rise. Meanwhile, Citigroup expects the ECB to raise rates to 4% by mid-2023. EUR/USD Technical levels The EUR/USD is neutral biased, though about to test the 200-day EMA. Tuesday’s fall below the 100-day EMA at 1.0554 exacerbated a fall toward the 200-day EMA, viewed as a trendsetter level for EUR/USD traders. A decisive break below 1.0536, the 200-day EMA would accelerate the EUR/USD pair fall toward 1.0500. Once cleared, the following support would be the YTD low at 1.0482, followed by the November 30 low at 1.0290.  What to watch? ",0
"Here is what you need to know on Thursday, March 9: It the second day of testimony, FOMC Chairman Jerome Powell did not surprise markets, after he left the door wide open to a 50 basis points rate hike at the March meeting, and the US Dollar jumped to monthly highs. After a brief retreat on Wednesday, the Greenback erased losses. If Dollar’s momentum holds, a test of the recent highs during the Asian session seems likely. China will report inflation, and Japan a new estimate of Q4 GDP.In the US, Automatic Data Processing (ADP) reported that private sector employment rose by 242K in February, surpassing expectations of 200K. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that January job openings reached 10.8 million, slightly higher than the market expectation of 10.6 million. The numbers continue to show a tight labor market, helping the US Dollar and supporting Fed’s hawkish tone. On Thursday, the weekly Jobless Claims report is due. Market participants await the Nonfarm payrolls on Friday and next week’s ConsumerPrice Index. Markets stabilized somewhat following Tuesday’s sell-off, but risk aversion dominates. US Treasury yields moved in tandem with the US Dollar, falling and then rebounding toward Tuesday’s highs. The US 10-year yield settled around 3.97%, and the 2-year rose back above 5%. EUR/USDrose to 1.0575, only to decline later below 1.0550. Despite mixed data from the Eurozone, market participants are looking to a higher terminal rate from theEuropean Central Bank, supporting the Euro. GBP/USDremains under pressure, although it holds near, but above, the critical 1.1800 area. EUR/GBP is hovering around 0.8900. Bank of England’s Swati Dhingra called for a no change in interest rates. USD/JPYposted a close above 137.00 but, at the same time, far from the daily high and below the 200-day Simple Moving Average.

" AUD/USDholds its place on the bear’s radar, after an initial attempt to leave the zone, as it stays depressed near 0.6590 amid early Thursday morning in Asia. The Aussie pair tried paring weekly losses at the lowest levels in four months during early Wednesday amid sluggish markets. However, dovish comments from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)Governor Philip Lowejoined upbeat US data and repetition of the hawkish statements from Federal ReserveChairman Jerome Powellconfirmed the bear’s dominance. It should be noted that the cautious mood ahead of today’s China inflation numbers seems to probe the risk barometer, due to its ties with the dragon nation. On early Wednesday, the US removed testing restrictions on the travelers from China and joined a light calendar to allow the traders to lick their wounds after a volatile Tuesday. However, RBA’s Lowe said that the RBA was closer to pausing its aggressive cycle of rate increases as the policy was now in the restrictive territory and there were signs the economy was responding. It should be noted that Lowe also mentioned, “China reopening is positive for our economy,” while also adding that no particular implications for inflation from China reopening. Elsewhere, Fed’s Powell repeated his hawkish calls of readiness to lift the rate while highlighting stronger-than-expected inflation pressure. The same bolstered calls for the Fed’s 50 bps rate hike but the Testimony 2.0 didn’t have anything new from what’s already heard on Tuesday and hence traders were mostly afraid of taking any major steps. Talking about the data, the US ADP Employment Change rose to 242K in February versus 200K market forecasts and 119K prior (revised). Further, the US Goods and Services Trade Balance dropped to $-68.3B from the $-67.2B previous reading (revised) and $-68.9B analysts’ estimations. It should be noted that the US JOLTS Job Openings for January improved to 10.824M versus 10.6M expected but eased from 11.234M revised prior. Against this backdrop, Wall Street closed mixed and the US Treasury bond yields remained firmer with minor moves and keeping the yield curve inversion the widest since 1981, which in turn allowed theUS Dollar Index(DXY) to remain firmer. Looking ahead, China’s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) and theProducer Price Index(PPI) for February will be important after the latest improvements in the Aussie-China ties. However, RBA’s Lowe has already mentioned no effects of the inflation emanating from China reopening on Canberra and the same could weigh on the AUD/USD in case of a downbeat outcome. Above all, Friday’s US Nonfarm Payrolls are the key to clear directions. Technical analysis AUD/USD sellers appear to run out of steam amid oversold RSI (14) conditions. With this, the 0.6540-20 support zone, marked during September-November 2022, gains major attention. The recovery moves, however, remain elusive unless the quote offers a daily closing beyond the one-month-old descending trend line, previous support around 0.6615. Additional important levels  ",0
"The GBP/USD pair is observing selling pressure around 1.1850 in the early Tokyo session after remaining sideways on Wednesday. The Cable might deliver sheer losses after surrendering the immediate support of 1.1800. The downside bias forthe Cablelooks favored as Federal Reserve (Fed) chairJerome Powellhas reiterated the need for biggerratesto bring down persistent United States inflation. S&P500 futures are showing modest gains, however, the recovery move looks less confident, which could be capitalized as a selling opportunity by the market participants. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) settled above 105.20 after a volatile day inspired by upbeat United States Employment data reported by Automatic Data Processing (ADP) agency. The release of the fresh payrolls addition at 242K vs. the consensus of 200K and the prior release of 119K has confirmed that the US labor market is extremely tight and investors should be prepared to face the extreme stubbornness of inflation. It is highly expected that firms will offer higher wages to fetch talent onboard amid a shortage of labor. This will deliver more funds to households for disposal, which will increase resilience in overall consumer spending. Also, upbeat Job Openings data added fuel to the fire. The economic data landed at 10.824 million vs. the consensus of 10.6K. Higher job openings demonstrate the overall demand, which is going to propel the ConsumerPrice Index(CPI). Later this week, the official labor market data will be keenly watched by the street. As per the estimates, the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) (Feb) is expected to land at 203K lower than the former bumper release of 517K. On the United Kingdom front, falling odds of more restrictive monetary policy is expected to keep the Pound Sterling on the tenterhooks.Bank of England(BoE) policy maker Swati Dhingra warned against further interest rate increases by citing “Overtightening poses a more material risk at this point.” She further added, “Many tightening effects are yet to fully take hold.” GBP/USD  ",0
"“The country's economy is on track to shrink less than expected this year and avoid the two quarters of negative growth which mark a technical recession,” the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) forecast on Wednesday per Reuters. Key findings Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would fall by 0.3% this year, a smaller decline than its previous forecast of a 1.3% fall, after stronger activity at the end of 2022. On a quarterly basis GDP is forecast to fall 0.3% in the first quarter of 2023, before showing zero growth in the second quarter and rising by 0.2% in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2023. The BCC expects the economy to grow 0.6% next year, while the Bank of England (BoE) predicted a quarter percent contraction for 2024 last month. Britain is the only Group of Seven economy that has yet to rebound to its pre-pandemic size and the BCC forecast it would not return to that level until the final quarter of 2024. While consumers and businesses still face a hit from double-digit inflation, the BCC expects inflation to drop to 5% in the fourth quarter and 1.5% by late 2024. The BCC expects BoE rates to be a quarter-point higher at the end of the year than they are now - taking rates to 4.25% - and then for rates to be cut to 3.5% by late 2024.

"  EUR/USD struggles to extend the previous day’s recovery moves from a two-month low, making rounds to 1.0550 during early Thursday. In doing so, the major currency pair traces the sluggish markets amid a light calendar and an absence of major surprises from the central bankers. It’s worth noting that the mixed data from the US andEurozonejoin the cautious mood ahead of Friday’s key jobs report to also restrict the Euro currency pair’s latest moves. Recently, US President Joe Biden’s proposal to inflate the corporation tax seems to weigh on the mood and tease EUR/USD sellers. Even so, the S&P 500 Futures remain 0.05% down on a day and fail to mark any notable moves on a broader front. On Wednesday, German Retail Sales dropped to -6.9% YoY for January from -6.4% prior and -6.1% analysts’ estimations while Industrial Production growth jumped to 3.5% versus 1.4% expected and -2.4% previous readings (revised). Further, the Eurozone Employment Change eased to 0.3% QoQ during the fourth quarter (Q4) versus 0.4% market forecasts and prior whereas the seasonally adjusted Gross Domestic Product (GDP) eased to 1.8% YoY during the said pair versus 1.9% expected and previous readings. Considering the data,ECBGoverning Council member Ignazio Visco said in a statement on Wednesday, “monetary policy will have to remain prudent.” The policymaker also added, “Monetary policy should be guided by data as it becomes available.” On the other hand, the US ADP Employment Change rose to 242K in February versus 200K market forecasts and 119K prior (revised). Further, the US Goods and Services Trade Balance dropped to $-68.3B from the $-67.2B previous reading (revised) and $-68.9B analysts’ estimations. It should be noted that the US JOLTS Job Openings for January improved to 10.824M versus 10.6M expected but eased from 11.234M revised prior. It should be noted that the benchmark US Treasury bond yields rose in the last three consecutive days and raised recession fears via the widest difference between the two-year and 10-year bond coupons. That said, Federal ReserveChairman Jerome Powellrepeated his hawkish remarks in front of the House Financial Service Committee. The policymaker highlighted the data dependency of the Fed while also signaling that they have underestimated the resilience of growth and inflation. Looking ahead, the second-tier US job numbers may entertain EUR/USD traders ahead of Friday’sUnited Statesemployment report. Technical analysis Although Wednesday’s Doji Candlestick challenges theEUR/USDbears around a two-month low, recovery remain elusive unless the quote offers a successful trading beyond an upward-sloping trend line from early December 2022, around 1.0555 by the press time.

"TheAUD/USDpair is displaying a back-and-forth action below the round-level resistance of 0.6600 in the Asian session. The Aussie asset looks vulnerable around the same as deepening fears of a recession in the United States amid expectations of higherratesby the Federal Reserve (Fed) have solidified the risk-aversion theme. S&P500 futures are showing nominal losses after a weak recovery move. It seems that the dead cat bounce move by the 500-US stocks basket is fading away. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has turned sideways above 105.20 after a mild correction, however, the upside looks favored amid upbeat United States Employment data. The solid addition of fresh payrolls in the US labor market in February due to rising demand has confirmed that fears of stubborn inflation among Fed policymakers were real. The US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) has reported an addition of 242K jobs in February, higher than the expectations of 200K and the former release of 119K. Therefore, Fed chairJerome Powellcited “Fed is prepared to announce more rates to bring down inflation.” Investors will get more clarity on the US labor market after the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data, which will release on Friday. Apart from that, the release of theUnemployment Rateand the Average Hourly Earnings data will be of utmost importance. After the fifth consecutive 25 basis points (bps) rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and a consideration of a policy-tightening pause led by a one-time blip in the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) by RBAGovernor Philip Lowe, the Australian Dollar has faced immense heat. Now, investors are shifting their focus toward China’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) (Feb) data. Annual China’s CPI is expected to decline to 1.9% from the prior release of 2.1%. On a monthly basis, China’s CPI has been trimmed to 0.2% from the former release of 0.8%.

"GBP/USD struggles to extend the previous day’s corrective bounce off the lowest levels since November 21, 2022, making rounds to 1.1850 on Thursday morning in Asia. In doing so, the Cable pair fails to justify the previous day’s bullish candlestick on the dailychart, namely the bullish spinning top. The reason could be linked to the pair’s sustained downside break of a 15-week-old ascending trend line, previous support near 1.1935, as well as the 200-DMA breakdown. Also adding strength to the downside bias are the bearish MACD signals. That said, the GBP/USD quote’s fresh weakness could aim for the 50%Fibonacciretracement level of November 2022 to January 2023 upside, near 1.1800. Following that, a slump toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level surrounding 1.1645, also known as the golden ratio, can’t be ruled out. Meanwhile, the 200-DMA hurdle of around 1.1900 restricts immediate GBP/USD recovery before highlighting the support-turned-resistance line close to 1.1935. Even ifthe Cablepair crosses the 1.1935 hurdle, a downward-sloping resistance line from early February, near 1.2055 could act as the last defense of the GBP/USD bears.

"China's ConsumerPrice Indexhas been released as follows: AUD/USD update AUD/USD is tucked in below 0.6600 in the Asian session and has shown little reaction to the data thus far. Instead, markets are fixated on prospects of higher rates by the Federal Reserve (Fed) which has weighed on risk appetite this week. About China Consumer Price Index The Consumer Price Index is released by theNational Bureau of Statistics of China. It is a measure of retail price variations within a representative basket of goods and services. The result is a comprehensive summary of the results extracted from the urban consumer price index and rural consumer price index. The purchase power of the CNY is dragged down by inflation. The CPI is a key indicator to measure inflation and changes in purchasing trends. A substantial consumer price index increase would indicate that inflation has become a destabilizing factor in the economy, potentially promptingThe People’s Bank of Chinato tighten monetary policy and fiscal policy risk. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) for the CNY, while a low reading is seen as negative (or Bearish) for the CNY.",0
"AUD/USD reverses the previous day’s corrective bounce off a four-month low, taking offers to refresh the intraday bottom near 0.6580, as inflation numbers from Australia’s key customer China came in softer for February. Adding strength to the downside bias could be the risk-off mood and hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) bets versus the dovish tone of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor. China’s headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped to 1.0% YoY versus 1.9% expected and 2.1% prior while theProducer Price Index(PPI) also declines to -1.4% from -0.8% previous readings and -1.3% market consensus. Also read:China CPI in at 1.0% vs 1.9% expected, AUD unchanged Apart from the downbeat Chinese inflation numbers, the market’s risk-off mood also seems to weigh on the AUD/USD price, mainly due to the pair’s risk-barometer status. It’s worth noting that the US yield curve inversion keeps recession fears on the table while US President Joe Biden’s budget proposal acts as an extra catalyst to weigh on sentiment, as well as the AUD/USD price. That said, the benchmark US Treasury bond yields rose in the last three consecutive days and raised recession fears via the widest difference between the two-year and 10-year bond coupons since 1981 the previous day. On the other hand, US President Joe Biden proposes raising corporation tax from 21% to 28% in his latest budget guide ahead of Friday’s release. Biden also aims for a 25% billionaire tax and large levies on rich investors. A likely lack of acceptance and political chaos due to the said budget proposal seems to weigh on themarket sentimentof late. With this, the S&P 500 Futures remain 0.05% down on a day and fail to mark any notable moves on a broader front by tracing Wall Street’s sluggish close. Above all, the divergence between the Fed and the RBA policymakers’ latest bias, with Fed ChairJerome Powelladvocating higherrateswhile RBAGovernor Philip Lowesignaling a policy pivot, keeps the AUD/USD bears hopeful. Looking ahead, US Initial Jobless Claims for the week ended on March 03 will join the Challenger Job Cuts for February to offer more details to predict Friday’s top-tier employment data.

S&P500 futures have given up their entire gains earned on Wednesday, portraying further strengthening of the risk-aversion theme. The weak risk appetite of investors has allowed the 10-year US Treasury yields to rebound above 3.98%. The latest headline of higher taxes on US billionaires and rich investors, a proposal endorsed by US President Joe Biden for the Budget is putting more pressure on US stocks.

Meanwhile, Pound Sterling might deliver a power-pack action after the release of the United Kingdom’s manufacturing sector data. Monthly Manufacturing production (Jan) and Industrial Production are expected to contract by 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Investors should be aware of the fact that the performance of the UK manufacturing sector has remained vulnerable in the past few months.

S&P500 futures have witnessed immense pressure as a sense of deflation conveyed by Chinese Consumer Price Index (CPI) andProducer Price Index(PPI) data indicates that the economy will take plenty of time to strengthen itseconomic outlook. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is auctioning in a limited range above 105.20 as investors are awaiting the release of the United States Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data for fresh impetus. AUD/USD has formed a Doji candlestick pattern, which indicates indecisiveness among the sentiment of market participants for further direction. Usually, a Doji formation indicates a reversal after an established trend. However, it requires more filters to confirm a reversal. Also, the negligence of Doji is considered as the continuation of the ongoing trend. The Australian Dollar might continue to face selling pressure from the 10-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around 0.6700.

"EUR/USDhas stretched its recovery above the immediate resistance of 1.0550 in the early European session. The major currency pair attempted recovery from 1.0540 as theUS Dollar Index(DXY) surrendered the critical support of 105.20. For building an upside bias, the shared currency pair has to fulfill plenty of filters. The USD Index has shifted into avolatilitycontraction phase after Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks-led perpendicular upside. The mighty USD Index is expected to remain sideways further till the release of the United States Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data. S&P500 futures have trimmed minor losses, however, the downside bias is still favored as US recession fears are escalating on expectations that Federal Reserve Powell will announce a bigger rate hike in March to press down the recovery move from the Consumer Price Index (CPI). A consideration of a higher terminal rate than previously anticipated from Federal Reserve Powell has already pushed two-year US Treasury yields to the highest level recorded in 2007. According to DoubleLine Capital LP Chief Investment Officer Jeffrey Gundlach, the bond market is doubling down on the prospect of a US recession after Federal Reserve ChairJerome Powellwarned of a return to large interest rate hikes, prompting the yield on two-year notes to rise to as much as 5.08%. The analyst believes that the Two-year US Treasury yields have not peaked yet, Bloomberg reported. A further increase in two-year US Treasury yields could dampen interest in growth and technology stocks as investors would be required to discount them with higherrates, which will trim their future cash flows. US Nonfarm Payrolls hogs limelight There is no denying the fact that Federal Reserve Powell has already warned the street that the central bank is prepared to raise rates further to bring down persistent inflation. However, the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data on Friday will provide more cues. According to the estimates, the official US Employment data is expected to show a decline in the number of payrolls added in February to 203K from the former release of 514k. A figure of 203K is not so bad but looks worthless in front of January’s 514K figure. Investors should be aware that a figure of 514K was an exceptional one in the past seven months. Apart from that, theUnemployment Rateis expected to remain steady at multi-decade low figures. Also, the Average Hourly Earnings are expected to increase to 4.8% on an annual basis as the shortage of labor would be offset by higher pay-off. Higher funds in the pocket of households might bring more resilience to consumer spending. Weak German Retail Sales look insufficient to press down hawkish ECB bets The spree of contracting German Retail Sales continued on Wednesday as households are facing higher price pressures. Individuals are struggling to offset the impact of inflation-adjusted prices of goods and services as the increment in the labor cost index is lower than the pace of the rising Consumer Price Index (CPI). Annual German Retail Sales (Jan) contracted consecutively for the ninth time. The economic data contracted by 6.9% while the street was expecting a contraction of 6.1%. Also, monthly Retail Sales data contracted by 0.3% against an expansion of 2.0% as expected. Despite contracting German Retail Sales, theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) could not consider a slowdown in the policy-tightening pace as the current inflation is four times the desired level. European Central Bank PresidentChristine Lagardeis expected to continue the 50 basis points (bps) rate hike cycle in March to tame the stubborn inflation. EUR/USD technical outlook  EUR/USD is forming an Inverted Flag chart pattern near the horizontal support plotted from February 27 low at 1.0533 on a four-hour scale. The chart pattern indicates a long consolidation that is followed by a breakdown.

"Further weakness could dragEUR/USDto the 1.0485 level in the next weeks, suggest UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected EUR to weaken further yesterday but we were of the view that ‘any decline is unlikely to break the major support at 1.0485’. We indicated ‘there is another support at 1.0530’. EUR dipped to 1.0523 in Asian trade before trading sideways for the rest of the sessions. EUR appears to have moved into a consolidation phase, and it is likely to trade in a range today, expected to be between 1.0520 and 1.0575.” Next 1-3 weeks: “There is not much to add to our update from yesterday (08 Mar, spot at 1.0550). As highlighted, after the sharp drop on Tuesday, downward momentum has improved, albeit not much. All in all, as long as EUR does not move above 1.0630 (‘strong resistance’ was at 1.0650 yesterday), it is likely to gravitate lower towards 1.0485.”",0
"Today, Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research at Commerzbank, is interested in the question of how FX traders would have to prepare for a scenario where central bankers’ nightmare were to become reality – if the massive rate hikes that were implemented and are yet to be realized were not sufficient to control inflation. What would happen to EUR/USD in an inflationary nightmare scenario? “I think anyone choosing between USD and EUR will be more likely to decide in favor of the greenback in view of these criteria. TheECBseems to have the reputation on the market of being a bit slow in the uptake. The fact that the Euro is not trading at stronger levels is likely to be at least partially due to its long hesitation. The FX market punishes those who come too late with a weak currency. “I was asked yesterday why I nonetheless expectEUR/USDto be stronger at year-end than now anyway. The answer is simple: because we project that this horror scenario does not arise. As a result every day when this does not happen is a good day for the European single currency.”",0
"The GBP/USD pair builds on the overnight modest bounce from the 1.1800 neighbourhood, or its lowest level since November and edges higher for the second successive day on Thursday. The pair sticks to a mildly positive tone and trades above the mid-1.1800s during the early part of the European session, though any meaningful upside still seems elusive. The US Dollar (USD) bulls take a breather following the recent strong run-up to over a three-month high, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor lending some support to the GBP/USD pair. That said, the prospects for more aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed), along with looming recession risks, act as a tailwind for the safe-haven Greenback and should cap gains for the major, at least for the time being. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the upcoming FOMC monetary policy meeting on March 21-22. The bets were lifted by hawkish comments by Fed ChairJerome Powell, reiterating that interestrateswould have to go higher and possibly faster to tame stubbornly high inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and favours the USD bulls. Themarket sentiment, meanwhile, remains fragile amid growing worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Apart from this, fading optimism over a strong economic recovery in China tempers investors' appetite for perceived riskier assets, which is evident from a softer tone around the equity markets and adds credence to the near-term positiveoutlookfor the Greenback. Apart from this, speculations that theBank of England(BoE) would pause the current tightening cycle suggest that the path of least resistance forthe GBP/USD pairis to the downside. Hence, any subsequent move up might still be seen as a selling opportunity. Traders now look to the US macro data - Challenger Job Cuts and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims - for a fresh impetus and short-term opportunities. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
"The USD/JPY pair comes under some selling pressure on Thursday and moves away from its highest level since mid-December, around the 137.90 region touched the previous day. The pair extends its steady intraday descent through the first half of the European session and drops to a fresh daily low, around the 136.20 region in the last hour. Worries about a deeper global economic downturn continue to weigh on investors' sentiment, which, in turn, is seen benefiting the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and dragging the USD/JPY pair lower. The concerns were further fueled by softer Chinese inflation figures released earlier this Thursday, which showed that domestic demand remains tepid and dashed hopes for a strong recovery in the world's second-largest economy. This, along with a modest US Dollar pullback from a three-month top, contributes to the offered toe surrounding the major. The downside for the USD/JPY pair, however, is more likely to remain limited, at least for the time being, amid expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will stick to its dovish stance to support the fragile domestic economy. The bets were reaffirmed by the release of the final GDP print, which pointed to continued weakness in the economy. Moreover, the incoming BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda recently stressed the need to maintain the ultra-loose policy settings and said that the central bank isn't seeking a quick move away from a decade of massive easing. In contrast, Federal Reserve ChairJerome Powellreiterated on Wednesday that interestrateswould have to go higher and possibly faster to tame stubbornly high inflation. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting on March 21-21, which remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields. This, in turn, favours the USD bulls and supports prospects for the emergence of some dip-buying around the USD/JPY pair, warranting caution before positioning for any meaningful corrective fall. Market participants now look to theUS economic docket, featuring the release of Challenger Job Cuts and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims later during the early North America session. The focus, however, will remain on theBoJmonetary policy decision, scheduled to be announced during the Asian session on Friday. This will be followed by the US monthly jobs data, popularly known as theNFPreport, which should help investors to determine the next leg of a directional move for theUSD/JPY pair.

"The combination of some profit taking in the greenback and bargain hunters breath in some life toEUR/USDand lift it to the 1.0565/70 band on Thursday. EUR/USD cautious ahead of US NFP EUR/USD trades with decent gains near 1.0570 and leaves behind two consecutive daily pullbacks, including a drop to 2-month lows near 1.0520 on Wednesday. The so far recovery in the pair comes amidst the moderate pullback in the dollar, which appears propped up at the same time by some lack of traction in US yields, all against the backdrop of rising cautiousness among traders ahead of the release of USNon-farm Payrollson Friday. In the meantime, firmer conviction of a 50 bps rate hike by the Fed at its March gathering continue to support the recent solid bounce in the greenback, while speculation that the ECB could extend its hiking cycle beyond the March meeting has so far failed to lent lasting legs to the European currency. Nothing scheduled data wise in the old continent should leave all the attention to the usual weekly Initial Claims across the pond. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD gives some signs of life following the recent drop to multi-week lows in the 1.0525/20 band in the wake of the hawkish intervention by Fed’s Powell before the Congress (Tuesday and Wednesday). In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB after the bank has already anticipated another 50 bps rate raise at the March event. Back to the euro area, the likely continuation of the normalization process by the ECB beyond the March meeting carries the potential to reignite recession concerns.

"TheAUD/USDpair regains positive traction on Thursday and moves further away from a nearly four-month low, around the 0.6570-0.6565 area touched the previous day. The pair maintains its bid tone through the first half of the European session and is currently placed near the daily high, comfortably above the 0.6600 round-figure mark. The US Dollar (USD) eases from over a three-month high and turns out to be a key factor pushing the AUD/USD pair higher. The USD downtick, meanwhile, lacks any obvious fundamental catalyst and is more likely to remain limited amid expectations for more aggressive policy tightening by the Fed. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the next FOMC policy meeting on March 21-22 and the bets were reaffirmed by hawkish comments by Fed ChairJerome Powell. On the second day of his testimony to the US Congress, Powell reiterated on Wednesday that interestrateswould have to go higher and possibly faster to tame stubbornly high inflation. This remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields and supports prospects for the emergence of some USD dip-buying. Apart from this, the prevalent cautious mood might further contribute to limiting losses for the safe-haven Greenback and capping gains for the risk-sensitive Australian Dollar. Themarket sentimentremains fragile amid worries about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Adding to this, fading optimism over a strong economic recovery in China tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets. This, along with the Reserve Bank of Australia's dovish shift earlierthis week, signalling that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, warrants caution for bulls and positioning for any further appreciating move for the AUD/USD pair. Market participants now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of Challenger Job Cuts and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, should influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair.

"GBP/USD bounces off the YTD lows of 1.1802 and rises above 1.1900, following Powell’s two-day appearance at the US Congress. Although Powell’s stance turned hawkish, US Thursday’s data might help the Fed to gradually increaserates, though further confirmation is needed on Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls. At the time of writing, the GBP/USD is trading at 1.1905 after hitting a low of 1.1828. Rising unemployment claims improved market sentiment, so the GBP rises Data revealed by the BLS, Jobless Claims for the week ending on March 4 were 211K higher than expected at 195K. Despite a strong ADP report on Wednesday and more job openings than anticipated, rising unemployment claims could ease the tightness of the labor market. A downbeat US Nonfarm Payrolls report, coupled with high unemployment claims, could reduce the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) needs to tighten conditions at a faster pace. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) edges down by 0.40%, at 105.225, a tailwind for the previously battered Pound Sterling (GBP). In addition, US Treasury bond yields are easing ahead of an essential jobs report and next Tuesday’s inflation data. On the UK front, an employment report will be released on March 14. Furthermore, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, will announce the spring budget. Aside from this, money market futures are pricing in a 91% chance that theBank of England(BoE) will increase rates by 25 bps on the BoE’s next meeting on March 23. GBP/USD Technical analysis After the GBP/USD fell to fresh YTD lows at 1.1802, the pair recovered some ground but clashed on an upslope trendline; previous support turned resistance around 1.1930s. The daily Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) reinforced the downtrend following the formation of a death cross that happened on February 3, which exacerbated the GBP/USD’s fall. Also, for a bullish continuation, the GBP/USD must conquer 1.2000. Contrarily, theGBP/USDfirst support would be 1.1900, which, once cleared, could pave the way to retest the YTD lows and 1.1800.

"In the morning forex report(if you don't watch it daily, you should), I spoke to the swing area for the EURUSD between 1.0578 to 1.0585 (and up to the 38.2%). Buyers - if they were to push higher - needed to get above that area. The high price today stalled against the high of the swing area. The price rotated back down - from that peak - toward 1.0564 which was a swing low going back to March 1. That level was broken on Tuesday. The price is back higher currently and once again trades between trade between the swing area. Overall, the story remains the same for the EURUSD.

"Here is what you need to know on Friday, March 10: US stocks dropped sharply on Thursday and US Treasuries rose ahead of Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report. Initial Jobless Claims unexpectedly climbed to the highest level in ten weeks, taking some bets for a 50 basis points Fed rate hike off the table. US yields moved further to the downside during the American session. The US 2-year yield fell to 4.95% and the 10-year to 3.92%. The slide in yields weighed on the US Dollar. The DXY pulled back for the second day in a row, falling to 105.20. The retreat of the Greenback is still a correction from Tuesday’s rally, which was boosted by Federal Reserve Chair Powell's hawkish remarks. US February Nonfarm Payrolls Preview: Analyzing Gold price's reaction to NFP surprises The US employment report will be released on Friday, with traders seemingly on the sidelines ahead of payrolls. The numbers could be critical for Fed rate expectations as the odds of a 50 basis points rate hike jumped during the current week. EUR/USDrose for the second day but was unable to retake 1.0600.

"TheUSD/JPY pairis delivering a sideways performance above 136.00 in the early Asian session. The asset looks vulnerable above 136.00 and is expected to deliver a break below the same as investors have shrugged-off fears associated with expectations of biggerratesfrom the Federal Reserve (Fed). Thursday’s Initial Jobless Claims data reported an 11% jump in the number of candidates claiming for the very first time. This was the highest jump in the past five months, which conveyed that the United States labor market is not tight enough as it appears to the market participants. The street believes that a mega jump in initial claims was the outcome of the mid-winter school break in New York. So it is a one-time blip and can be ignored. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is juggling above 105.25 after a gradual correction from Wednesday’s high at 105.86. S&P500 futures witnessed an intense sell-off on Thursday as investors got distressed by high taxes proposed by US President Joe Biden on billionaires and rich investors. Citing the Budget as a blue-collar blueprint, more taxes on riches will be utilized for medical claims of retired individuals. Squeezing fears for Fed’s blunt statement on using higher rates to bring down inflation also supported the demand for US government bonds. The alpha generated on 10-year US Treasury bonds dropped firmly to near 3.90%. On the Japanese Yen front, investors are awaiting theinterest rate decisionby the Bank of Japan (BoJ) for fresh impetus. Analysts at TD Securities are of the view that “It is unlikely that the BoJ will rock the boat at this meeting even as CPI inflation hit a 41-year high. GovernorKurodaat his last meeting will likely keep policy unchanged, with further changes having to wait for incoming governor Ueda starting in April.

" AUD/USDjustifies its risk-barometer status while revisiting the sub-0.6600 area early Friday, after a failed attempt to recover from the four-month low. In doing so, the Aussie pair traces the downbeatequitiesand fears emanating from China, as well as failing to cheer the retreat in the US Treasury bond yield and the US Dollar, amid the market’s cautious mood ahead of the all-important US employment data. Wall Street benchmarks closed with more than 1.5% daily losses each but the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields eased to 3.92% and 4.87% versus 5.08% and 4.01% daily open respectively. It should be noted that theUS Dollar Index(DXY) managed to pare some of the daily losses by the end of Thursday but failed to ignore the biggest daily fall in a week. While tracing the key catalysts mixed employment clues from the US gain major attention. That said, US Initial Jobless Claims marked the biggest jump since January by rising to 211K for the week ended on March 03 versus 195K expected and 190K prior. Additionally, the Challenger Job Cuts were down and the Continuing Jobless Claims were up. Elsewhere, disappointment from China’s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) andProducer Price Index(PPI) data for February also dims the prospects of recovery in the world’s second-largest economy and weighs on the risk profile. On the same line could be the fears of higher taxes in the world’s biggest economy, the US, as well as the political chaos relating to it as US President Joe Biden proposes raising corporation tax from 21% to 28% in his latest budget guide ahead of Friday’s release.

" GBP/USD makes rounds to 1.1930-20 during early Friday morning in Asia as bulls take a breather after the biggest daily jump in more than a week ahead of the key statistics from the UK and the US. That said, the risk-off mood failed to extend the US Dollar’s run-up on Thursday amid US data, which in turn joined a retreat in the key US Treasury bond yields to weigh on the greenback. While portraying the mood, Wall Street benchmarks closed with more than 1.5% daily losses each but the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields eased to 3.92% and 4.87% versus 5.08% and 4.01% daily open respectively. It should be noted that theUS Dollar Index(DXY) managed to pare some of the daily losses by the end of Thursday but failed to ignore the biggest daily fall in a week. At home, hopes of economic recovery and morestockmarket listings seem to helpthe Cablepair amid a light calendar during the week. “The country's economy is on track to shrink less than expected this year and avoid the two-quarters of negative growth which mark a technical recession,” the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) forecast on Wednesday per Reuters. Britain’s finance ministry said on Wednesday it will launch a review into how investor research on companies could be improved to attract more listings, a step that follows a decision by UK chip designer Arm Ltd to only list in New York, reported Reuters. On the same line, Britain's revamped financial market rules will largely be aligned with U.S. and European Union regulations to minimize disruption to global companies, its financial services minister Andrew Griffith said on Thursday per Reuters. It’s worth observing, however, thatBank of England(BoE) policy maker Swati Dhingra warned against interest rate hikes on Wednesday while saying that overtightening poses a more material risk at this point. On the contrary, FedChairman Jerome Powellkeeps his hawkish bias intact. Given the fact that the BoE appears less hawkish than the Fed, a likely easing in today’s UK macros may allow the return of the GBP/USD bears. However, negative surprises from the US employment data for February won’t be taken lightly as the latest market chatters put less weight on the 50 bps talks than the mid-week conditions.

"EUR/USD picks up bids to extend the mid-week recovery from a two-month low, up 0.16% intraday near 1.0600 during early Friday. In doing so, the Euro pair cheers the broad weakness in the US Dollar ahead of the key US employment report for February, as well as a speech fromEuropean Central Bank(ECB) PresidentChristine Lagarde. The major currency pair snapped a two-day losing streak the previous day as mixed US data joined a retreat in the US Treasury bond yields. Adding strength to the run-up were the hawkish ECB talks and the market’s positioning for today’s key US data. However, inflation fears join the geopolitical tension to challenge the EUR/USD buyers. That said, US Initial Jobless Claims marked the biggest jump since January by rising to 211K for the week ended on March 03 versus 195K expected and 190K prior. Additionally, the Challenger Job Cuts were down and the Continuing Jobless Claims were up. With this, the early signals for Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) appear mixed and challenge the market’s push for 0.50% Fed rate hike in March, as backed by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s latest signals. Despite the mixed data, fears of inflation keep favoring the Fed hawks, especially afterChairman Jerome Powelldefends the tighter monetary policy, which in turn caps the Euro prices. It should be noted that the latest report from the New York Fed mentioned that recent upward revisions to inflation data coupled with higher-than-expected levels of inflation had changed the picture on what had appeared to be cooling in price pressures. On the other hand, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday that they will bring inflation back to 2% by end-2024 or end-2025. Apart from the aforementioned catalysts, the geopolitical fears emanating from US President Joe Biden’s budget proposal for 2024 and the US partnership with the UK and Australia for nuclear submarines should also challenge the EUR/USD buyers. Against this backdrop, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields extend the previous day’s losses to 3.88% by the press time and weigh on theUS Dollar Index(DXY), down 0.10% to 105.12 at the latest. That said, Wall Street benchmarks closed with more than 1.5% daily losses each, which in turn directed S&P 500 Futures to print mild losses by the press time. Looking ahead, market forecasts suggest an overall easing in the US employment report for February. The same contrasts with the hawkish Fed bias to highlight the odds of a strong market move in favor of the US Dollar in case of a positive surprise. However, the same requires validation from ECB’s Lagarde.

Also, investors have started shrugging offvolatilityassociated with aggressive Fed rate hike bets. Investors understand the fact that higher inflation could be tamed by restrictive measures from the Fed, therefore, more rates from the Fed are a reality. S&P500 futures have extended their losses in the Asian session after a nosedive Thursday where investors were discouraged by higher taxes on corporations, billionaires, and rich investors. Higher taxes on corporations will trim their Net Profit margins and investors would get reduced dividends on their investments. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has dropped below Thursday’s low at 105.13 on hopes that the US labor market is not solid now as considered earlier.

This might compel the Fed to continue its moderate pace for hikingratesfurther. However, the release of the USNFPwill be of utmost importance to the market.

S&P500 futures have extended losses firmly as the higher tax burden endorsed by US President Joe Biden to support the blue-collar section has discouraged investors. US Biden proposed an increase in corporation tax from 21% to 28%. Also, rich investors are liable to pay hefty taxes now. A sheer sell-off in the 500-US stocks basket is portraying a dismal market mood. Meanwhile, the demand for US government bonds is accelerating as investors are skeptical about the United States labor market after a surprise jump in the Initial Jobless Claims released on Thursday. A jump in jobless claims by 11%, the highest in the past five months indicates that the US labor market is getting complicated now. Also, a four-fold planned lay-off reported by Reuters indicates that the strength in the labor market is fizzing out. For transparency on the status of the US labor market, US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data will be keenly watched. According to the estimates, the world’s largest economy has added fresh 203K payrolls in February, lower than the bumper release of 517K recorded for January. TheUnemployment Rateis expected to remain steady at 3.4%. AUD/USD  ",0
"TheUSD/JPY pairis displaying avolatilitycontraction around 136.65 after sheer volatility inspired by the continuation of an ultra-easy monetary policy by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). BoJ Governor HaruhikoKurodacontinued expansionary monetary policy as the domestic demand and wages have failed to spurt inflation in the Japanese economy. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is gathering strength in extending its recovery above the immediate resistance of 105.35. The USD Index has been extremely quiet as investors are awaiting the release of theUnited StatesNonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data. S&P500 futures are continuously accelerating losses as fears of aggressive interestratesby the Federal Reserve (Fed) are skyrocketing. Meanwhile, the demand for US government bonds is soaring, which has trimmed the 10-year US Treasury yields further below 3.82%. On an hourly scale, USD/JPY has rebounded firmly from the upward-sloping trendline plotted from March 06 low at 135.37. The asset has extended its recovery above the critical resistance of 136.45, which has turned into support for the US Dollar bulls. The recovery move in the USD/JPY looks full of strength as the asset has scaled above the 20-and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 136.40 and 136.55 respectively. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is making efforts in shifting into the bullish range of 60.00-80.00. An occurrence of the same will trigger the upside momentum. Going forward, a break above the intraday high at 137.00 will drive the asset toward March 08 high at 137.90 followed by November 28 high at 139.43. Alternatively, a downside move below the intraday low at 135.82 will drag the asset toward March 01 low at 135.26. A slippage below the latter will expose the asset to February 24 low at 134.06.

Additional quotes 2% price target is appropriate as it is a global standard. Monetary easing has been successful in terms of supporting Japan's economic potential. Positive effects of monetary easing far exceeded side-effects. True that two sales tax hikes affected consumption, consumer inflation. Not thinking Abenomics has put too much burden on monetary policy. Premature to debate specifics on exit from monetary easing. Monetary easing exit must be conducted only when 2% inflation is sustainably, stably achieved. Inappropriate to comment on exit in 2023 or 2024. Central banks are responsible for price stability. Various factors were behind japan's deflation such as financial crisis, abnormal yen strength and rising China. 'Shunto' labour talks will most likely result in higher wages than before. Yield curve distortion has not completely been resolved although curve is becoming somewhat smooth. Market function will gradually improve. Wage trends including base salary hikes are extremely important for BoJ’s goal. Sustainable, stable achievement of inflation target must be evaluated with economy, price trends, underlying mechanism, not just by one indicator. Expect market's yield formation under new BoJ operation guideline to take some time. Close but yet to reach achievement of 2% inflation target sustainably, stably in tandem with wage growth.

"The GBP/USD pairattracts some buyers during the early European session on Friday and climbs to a three-day high, around mid-1.1900s in reaction to the better-than-expected UK monthly GDP print. The UK Office for National Statistics reported that the economy grew by 0.3% in January as compared to the 0.5% contraction recorded in the previous month and the 0.1% growth expected. This, to a larger extent, offsets the disappointing release of the UK Manufacturing and Industrial Production figures, which, in turn, is seen lending some support to the British Pound. Apart from this, the ongoing US Dollar retracement slide from a three-month low lends additional support to the GBP/USD pair. A larger-than-expected rise in the US Weekly Jobless Claims was seen as the first sign of a softening labor market and forced investors to reassess the possibility of a 50 bps lift-off at the upcoming FOMC meeting on March 21-22. This is reinforced by a further pullback in the US Treasury bond yields and continues to weigh on the Greenback. The USD bulls, meanwhile, fail to gain any respite from the prevalent risk-off environment - as depicted by a sea of red across the global equity markets. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bullish bets around the GBP/USD pair and positioning for an extension of this week's recovery move from the 1.1800 mark, or a fresh YTD low ahead of the USNFPreport.

"Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group noteEUR/USDcould still slip back below the 1.0500 level. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we expected EUR to trade in a range between 1.0520 and 1.0590. However, EUR edged to a high of 1.0590 before settling at 1.0580 (+0.34%). EUR could continue to edge higher today but it is unlikely to break the strong resistance at 1.0630 (minor resistance is at 1.0605). Support is at 1.0560, a breach of 1.0540 would indicate that the current mild upward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from two days ago (08 Mar, spot at 1.0550) is still valid. As highlighted, after the sharp drop on Tuesday, downward momentum has improved, albeit not much.

"TheAUD/USDpair attracts some buyers near the 0.6565 region on Friday and recovers early lost ground to a fresh four-month low. Spot prices climb back closer to the 0.6600 round-figure mark during the early European session and draw support from some follow-through US Dollar selling. In fact, the USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, retreats further from a three-month high amid reduced bets for more aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. Data released on Thursday showed a larger-than-expected rise in the US Weekly Jobless Claims and was seen as the first sign of a softening labor market. This forced investors to reassess the possibility of a  50 bps lift-off at the upcoming FOMC meeting on March 21-22, which is evident from the ongoing downfall in the US Treasury bond yields and continues to weigh on the buck. That said, the prevalent risk-off environment lends some support to the safe-haven Greenback and could keep a lid on any meaningful upside for the risk-sensitive Australian Dollar. Themarket sentimentremains fragile amid concerns about economic headwinds stemming from rapidly rising borrowing costs. Adding to this, the recent softer Chinese macro data dashed hopes for a strong recovery in the world's second-largest economy and further fueled recession fears. This is reinforced by a deepening of the yield curve and tempers investors' appetite for perceived riskier assets. Apart from this, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) dovish shift earlierthis week, signalling that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, might contribute to capping gains for the AUD/USD pair. Traders might also prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the release of the closely-watched US monthly jobs data,  due later during the early North American session.

"TheBank of England(BoE) is unlikely to do many favours to Sterling, in the view of economists at Commerzbank. BoE will always seem to be lagging behind developments “As long as the BoE sticks to its rather cautious communication, contrary to the Fed and theECB, Sterling is likely to principally remain under depreciation pressure.” “As far as its communication is concerned the BoE will always seem to be lagging behind developments rather than fighting high levels of inflation actively, thus creating concerns that it might drop behind the curve with its monetary policy. That means monetary policy continues to put pressure on Sterling.” ",0

EUR/USD looks at USD, Payrolls EUR/USD extends further the bounce off multi-week lows recorded in the wake of Powell’s first testimony on Tuesday and pierces the 1.0600 barrier at the end of the week. In fact, the renewed offered bias in the greenback forced the USD Index (DXY) to give away part of the recent upside in tandem with the loss of traction in US yields across the curve and dwindling bets of a half percentage point interest rate hike by the Fed at the March 22 meeting.

"The USD/JPY pair shows some resilience below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and attracts fresh buying near the 135.80 region, or a multi-day low touched earlier this Friday. The pair stick to its gains through the first half of the European session and is currently placed around the 136.75 area, just a few pips below the daily peak. The Japanese Yen (JPY) fell sharply on the last day of the week after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained its ultra-dovish stance and left monetary policy settings unchanged. The decision was widely on expected lines, though some analysts were speculating that HaruhikoKurodawould tweak the yield curve control (YCC) at his last policy meeting as BoJ governor. This, in turn, sent the Japanese bond yields tumbling, which, in turn, weighed on the domestic currency and assisted the USD/JPY pair to regain positive traction. That said, the prevalent risk-off environment - as depicted by a sea of red across the global equity markets - helps limit losses for the safe-haven JPY. Apart from this, some follow-through US Dollar selling contributes to keeping a lid on any further gains for the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. Market participants were forced to reassess expectations for a jumbo 50 bps lift-off at the March FOMC meeting after a larger-than-expected rise in the US Weekly Jobless Claims, which was seen as the first sign of a softening labor market. Reduced bets for a more aggressive policy tightening by the Fed lead to a further decline in the US Treasury bond yields and keep the USD bulls on the defensive. Traders, however, seem reluctant and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the release of the closely-watched US monthly employment details, popularly known asNFP.

Despite this, a future adjustment to YCC remains likely under Ueda. We expect Ueda will order a policy review early on, which we think will serve as a platform to make changes to YCC as early as Q2.” “USD/JPY at +137 should be key resistance ahead of theNFP. But the ball is in the USD's court for now, and shouldjobssignificantly surprise to the upside (>300K) alongside a strong CPI report next week, 140 does not seem implausible.” “We expect to see more insulation on cross/JPY however.

The headlineNFPshowed that the US economy added 311K new jobs in February, beating consensus estimates for a reading of 205K by a big margin. This, however, marks a sharp slowdown from the previous month's downwardly revised reading of 504K. Adding to this, theunemployment rateunexpectedly rose to 3.6% from 3.4% and wages also fell short of market estimates, rising by 0.2% for the month and a 4.6% YoY rate. The data further points to a softening US labor market and forces investors to scale back their bets for a jumbo 50 bps rate hike at the upcoming FOMC meeting on March 21-21, which is evident from a further decline in the US Treasury bond yields. Apart from this, a goodish recovery in the US equity futures weighs heavily on the safe-haven US Dollar, which, in turn, assists the GBP/USD pair to build on its strong intraday gains. The British Pound, on the other hand, continues to draw support from the better-than-expected UK monthly GDP print, which showed that the economy expanded by 0.3% in January.

The technicals show the consensus of the ""market"" traders who are reacting to the fundamentals. They help to define the bias. Looking at the hourly chart above, the AUDUSD moved higher after the jobs report with the overall dollar weakness. However, the price did find willing sellers near the falling 100 hour moving average (blue line in the chart above). That level comes in at 0.66278. The high price reached 0.66325. In addition to that level, the swing highs from yesterday and Wednesday also formed a ceiling between 0.6628 and 0.66356. So although the price moved above the 100 hour moving average briefly, it remained within the swing highs from both yesterday and Wednesday. There is some reluctance to move higher. Technically if the buyers are to take more control, getting above that area along with the 100 hour moving average would be required. Absent that and the buyers are not winning. Also in play is the 38.2% retracement of the move down from the high last Friday.

However, what is more decisive for our EUR/USD projections is that we do not expect any ECB rate cuts until the end of the forecasting horizon in late 2024 anymore, whereas we assume that the US will lower its key rate even further in 2024 than previously projected.” “We have left our EUR/USD projections for 2023 unchanged, but now expect a further rise inEUR/USDto 1.12 until mid-2024.” “Only in the second half of next year EUR is likely to weaken again as the realisation is then going to take effect that inflation in the Eurozone is more stubborn and that the ECB was not restrictive enough to return inflation to its target. This will put pressure on the Euro.”  Source: Commerzbank Research ",1

The DXY erased all the gains that followed Federal Reserve Jerome Powell's hawkish remarks. The US economy added morejobsthan forecast in February (311K vs 205K) and confirmed the shocking numbers of January. However, theUnemployment Raterose to 4.6% and wage growth slowed down. Before NFP, expectations about a 50 basis points rate hike at the next FOMC meeting were elevated and then pulled back, pushing US yields to the downside. Treasury bonds also rose amid risk aversion. The VIX (Fear index) jumped on Friday to 27.42, a level not seen since late October. US stock indices added to losses on Friday, ending the week with a decline of more than 4%. Next week will be quiet on Fed talk as FOMC enters the blackout period. It will be time for rumours and speculations ahead of the March 21-22 meeting. Analysts differ in their forecast, some going for a 25 bps hike and others for 50 bps. The key economic report that could end the debate will be on Tuesday with the US Consumer Price Index. Those numbers would be critical for the consideration of the Fed's rate hike. More inflation numbers are due on Wednesday with the Produce Price Index; also Retail Sales will be reported the same day. DXYpeaked near 106.00, the highest since November and then dropped all the way back to 104.50. The US 2-year Treasury yield rose to the highest since 2007 at 5.08%, falling on Friday to 4.58%, the lowest in three weeks. Despite DXY's reversal, the Dollar held onto weekly gains versus emerging market and commodity currencies. USD/JPYdropped for the second week in a row after being unable to consolidate above 137.00 hit by lower bond yields and the sell-off in Wall Street.

Theunemployment rateedged higher to 3.6% as the participation rate rose 0.1% to 62.5%. Average hourly earnings slowed to 0.2% MoM (4.6% YoY).

"USD/JPY takes a U-turn from the one-month low, marked earlier in Asia, as it picks up bids to 134.50 amid an initial hour of Tokyo open on Monday. Even so, the Yen pair remains on the back foot for the third consecutive day as Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s retirement propels hawkish calls for the Japanese central bank’s next moves. Also challenging the pair buyers could be the cautious mood ahead of this week’s top-tier data/events, including the BoJ Minutes and the US consumer-centric numbers including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Sales for February. The Yen pair’s latest rebound could be linked to the recently firmer US Treasury bond yields, as well as risk-on sentiment in the market, mainly driven by the US regulators’ efforts to tame the financial market risks emanating from the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields pare the biggest daily loss in four months near 3.75% while the S&P 500 Futures also rebound from a nine-week low.

Despite the risk-on mood, escalating hawkish bets on the BoJ’s next move, especially after Kuroda’s retirement, seem to exert downside pressure on the USD/JPY prices.

While reacting to the US regulators’ actions, US President Joe Biden said, “American people and American businesses can have confidence that their bank deposits will be there when they need them.” It should be noted that China’s dislike for the US interference in Taiwan matters and the better-than-expected US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) seem to probe the risk-on mood ahead of this week’s top-tier data/events. On Friday, the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) grew more than 205K expected to 311K in February, versus 504K (revised), while theUnemployment Raterose to 3.6% for the said month compared to 3.4% expected and prior. Further, the Average Hourly Earnings rose on YoY but eased on monthly basis for February whereas the Labor Force Participation increased during the stated month. The data, however, failed to impress the US Dollar buyers as the market’s risk-off mood drowned the US Treasury bond yields and the greenback. It’s worth observing that the market’s fears of no Fed rate hikes in March, due to the latest imbalance in the US banking sector due to the SVB and Signature Bank fallout, also seem to weigh n the US Dollar. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures bounced off a 2.5-month low, up nearly 1.0% around 3,905 by the press time whereas the US Treasury bond yields recover from the monthly low, after posting the biggest daily loss of the year 2023 on Friday. Moving on, market plays may witness a sluggish session on Monday amid a cautious mood ahead of top-tier data/events. That said, the ECB is likely to announce a 0.50% rate hike and can join the latest risk-on mood to propel the EUR/USD price. Though, strong prints of the US consumer-centric data and inflation may renew hawkish Fed bias and can exert downside pressure on the major currency pair moving forward. Technical analysis The EUR/USD pair’s higher highs on price fail to gain support from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) 14 as it forms a lower high, which in turn suggests a lack of enough bullish momentum to cross the immediate key hurdle, namely the 200-SMA level surrounding 1.0710.

A clear U-turn from the 200-DMA, as well as a downside break of the 100-DMA, joins a sustained downside break of a five-week-old bullish channel to favor USD/JPY sellers. On the same line could be the strongest bearish MACD signals since early December 2022. With this, the Yen pair appears all set to slump toward the 50-DMA support of 132.50. However, the early February swing highs near 132.90 seem to prod the USD/JPY sellers of late. In a case where the USD/JPY price remains bearish past the 50-DMA, the 130.00 round figure and the previous monthly low surrounding 128.00 will be in the spotlight. On the flip side, a convergence of the 100-DMA and the aforementioned channel’s lower line, close to 135.85, holds the key to USD/JPY pair’s recovery. Even so, the 200-DMA can test the upside momentum near 137.50 before directing prices towards the aforementioned channel’s top line, close to 139.50 at the latest.

" AUD/USD bulls celebrate the biggest daily gains since early February around the 0.6665-70 hurdle during early Monday in Europe. The Aussie pair’s latest inaction could be linked to its struggle to overcome the five-week-old descending resistance line amid the broadly risk-on mood, as well as the US Dollar weakness. While portraying the mood, S&P 500 Futures bounced off a 2.5-month low, up nearly 1.60% around 3,960 by the press time. It’s worth noting that the Asia-Pacific equities trade mixed as they’re yet to overcome Friday’s bond andstockmarket rout, as well as bear the burden of China-linked fears. A new term for China’s President Xi Jinping keeps the Sino-American tension on the table as he said earlier on Monday that they must resolutely oppose the interference of external forces, 'split' of Taiwan. It’s worth mentioning that Wall Street saw the red on Friday while the US bond yields also dropped the most in a month amid fears emanating from the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fallout. However, the US Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took joint actions to tame the risks during the weekend.  While reacting to the US regulators’ actions, US President Joe Biden said, “American people and American businesses can have confidence that their bank deposits will be there when they need them.” The fallout of the SVB and Signature Bank flagged fragile conditions of the US banks, which in turn pushed back hopes of more rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve (Fed). With this in mind, Goldman Sachs expects to rate hike in March while the Fed Fund Futures also cut previously upbeat odds favoring a 0.50% rate lift in the Fed rate in March.

Additionally, the major currency pair’s successful upside break of a one-month-old descending resistance line, now support around 1.0630, joins the sustained bounce off the 100-DMA level surrounding 1.0540 to favor the EUR/USD bulls. Even if the Euro bears manage to conquer the 1.0540 support, the low marked so far in March near 1.0525 precedes January’s bottom surrounding 1.0480 to challenge the further downside. On the flip side, the EUR/USD pair’s daily closing beyond the 1.0730 resistance confluence could quickly direct buyers towards a three-month-old resistance line, near 1.0820 at the latest. It should, however, be noted that the Euro pair’s run-up beyond 1.0820 may need validation from late January’s swing high of near 1.0930 before challenging the previous monthly top close to 1.1035. Overall,EUR/USDis likely to rise further but a daily closing beyond 1.0730 could fasten the run-up. EUR/USD: Daily chart  Trend: Further upside expected Additional important levels  ",1
"Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia now seeEUR/USDnavigating within the 1.0560-1.0800 range for the time being. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected EUR to ‘continue to edge higher’ last Friday but we were of the view that it ‘is unlikely to break strong resistance at 1.0630’. However, EUR strengthened more than expected, jumping to a high of 1.0700. Upward momentum has improved, albeit not significantly. Today, EUR could advance further to 1.0740. The major resistance at 1.0800 is not expected to come under threat. On the downside, a breach of 1.0620 (minor support is at 1.0660) would indicate that the current upward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our latest narrative was from last Wednesday (08 Mar, spot at 1.0550) where the slight improvement in downward momentum is likely to lead to EUR gravitating lower to 1.0485. Last Friday, EUR jumped above our ‘strong resistance’ of 1.0630. The breach of the ‘strong resistance’ indicates that downward pressure has eased. We view the current price actions as part of a consolidation range and expect EUR to trade between 1.0560 and 1.0800 for the time being.”",0
"GBP/USDsticks to its mixed outlook and is expected to trade between 1.1950 and 1.2240 in the next weeks, suggest Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We did not anticipate the strong surge in GBP to 1.2112 last Friday (we were expecting GBP to trade in a range). The rapid rise has scope to test 1.2145. The major resistance at 1.2240 is not expected to come into view. Support is at 1.2040, followed by 1.2000.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Last Friday (10 Mar, spot at 1.1915), we indicated that ‘downward momentum is beginning to fade and a break of 1.1950 would indicate that GBP is unlikely to weaken further’. However, we did not anticipate GBP jumping to a high of 1.2112. After the recent sharp but short-lived swings, theoutlookfor GBP is mixed. For the time being, we expect GBP to trade in a broad range of 1.1950/1.2240.”",0
"In the opinion of Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia, a potential drop to the 0.6500 region inAUD/USDseems to be losing traction in the short term. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Last Friday, we held the view that AUD ‘is likely to trade with a downward bias but 0.6560 is expected to offer strong support’. AUD subsequently dropped to 0.6565 before rebounding to a high of 0.6641. While there is no significant improvement in upward momentum, AUD could advance further to 0.6660. The strong resistance at 0.6700 is unlikely to come under threat. On the downside, a breach of 0.6580 (minor support is at 0.6600) would indicate that AUD is unlikely to advance further.” Next 1-3 weeks: “In our most recent narrative from last Wednesday (08 Mar, spot at 0.6585), we highlighted that AUD ‘is likely to weaken further but any weakness is likely to be at a slower pace’. We added, ‘The major support at 0.6500 may not come into view so soon’. Last Friday, AUD dipped to 0.6565 before rebounding sharply. Downward pressure is beginning to ease and the odds of AUD dropping to 0.6500 have diminished. However, only a break of 0.6700 (no change in ‘strong resistance’ level) would indicate that AUD has moved into a consolidation phase.”",0
"Further downside inUSD/JPYshould meet decent contention around the 133.00 region, note Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted last Friday that while there is scope for USD to weaken, any decline is viewed as a lower trading range of 135.50/137.00. However, USD sold off sharply before extending its drop in Asian trade. The sharp drop appears to be overdone but with no signs of stabilization just yet, USD could weaken further. That said, the major support at 133.00 is likely out of reach today. On the upside, a breach of 135.50 (minor resistance is at 135.00) would indicate that the weakness in USD has stabilized.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Last Friday (10 Mar, spot at 136.40), we held the view that USD ‘appears to have entered a consolidation phase’ and we expected it to trade within a range of 135.00/138.00. We did not anticipate the sharp selloff to 134.10. The sharp drop appears to be running ahead of itself but there is scope for USD to weaken further. At this stage, we expect any decline could be limited to 133.00. Overall, only a breach of the ‘strong resistance’ level at 136.40 would indicate that USD is not weakening further.”",1
"EUR/USDreached its highest level in a month above 1.0700. In the view of economists at ING, the pair is biased to the 1.0780/1.0800 zone.

This is EUR/USD positive.” “Unless there is a massive rally in US banking stocks today which suggested that US authorities had been incredibly successful in putting the genie of US banking sector risk back in the bottle, we would say EUR/USD is biased to the 1.0780/1.0800 area.” ",1

Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen to stay bid “The first major US financial crisis since 2008 has seen a significant bullish disinversion of the US yield curve – which is Dollar bearish.” “We have been arguing for some that time that bullish disinversion would be required to send the Dollar lower – but had felt that it would be US disinflation or weak activity data – not a financial crisis – which would be the trigger.” “Expect investors to remain warythis weekand continue to prefer the CHF and JPY over the Dollar. In a way, we are going back to former periods of risk aversion – when selling the Dollar and buying US two-year Treasury notes was the key strategy in a crisis.”",0
"Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research, highlights how quickly the US Dollar could lose its safe haven status. ASECBexpectations are being revised to the downside, but to a much lesser extent than the Fed's, the Euro is set to profit. ECB policy seems much cleverer “It is much less likely this morning that the Fed will add another 50 bps – seeing that the policy implemented so far has already caused considerable stress.” “So far, I have found nobody who projects a rate cut, but I expect the first projections of this nature during the day if nervousness does not ease immediately.” “And not just that the Fed expectations are now having to be massively revised to the downside. Suddenly the much more cautious ECB policy seems much cleverer. Because it leaves more time for market participants to adjust.” “That is how quickly the Dollar can lose its status as a safe haven, which it enjoyed against the Euro recently!” ",1

AUD and CAD: Consolidate before strengthening “We think that the AUD and CAD are likely to move mostly sideways over the near term; with the focus remaining on US data, and how it could shape the 25 bps vs 50 bps debate for the 21-22 March Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting.” “Over the longer term when some of the uncertainties around the Fed, the US economy’s landing, and China’s recovery subside, the AUD and CAD are likely to strengthen against the USD.”",1
"The EUR has regained upward momentum in recent weeks. Economists at MUFG Bank expect higherEurozonerates, diminished recession risk and China reopening to provid more support for the shared currency. Downside risks to EUR limited from ECB policy update “The EUR should continue to trade at stronger levels in the near-term supported by: i) hawkish expectations for furtherECBpolicy tightening, ii) the diminished risk of a sharper slowdown in the Eurozone economies as natural gas prices continue to fall, and ii) China reopening optimism.” “We see limited risk of a dovish policy surprise from the ECB in the week ahead that could trigger a significant EUR sell-off given the recent run of stronger Eurozone activity and core inflation data.” ",1

The high-priced reached just above that level at 0.6678. The price has already moved back down below the technical levels and trades at 0.6660 currently in very volatile trading. Note that earlier today, the price tested the 200 hour moving average/50% retracement and found sellers. So this is the second attempt to extend above those levels. Earlier today, the failure to get above the 200 hour moving average sent price back down toward the 100 hour moving average currently at 0.6606 (blue line in the chart above). Buyers leaned against that moving average as well and pushed the price back to the upside. So overall we are seeing the price action more or less being confined by the 100 hour moving average below at 0.6606, and the 200 hour moving average/50% retracement above at 0.66733.

A sharp drop in US yields occurs as investors shift their bets for a softer Federal Reserve, amid market concerns about the banking industry. DXY slumps on a new scenario The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its effect are driving markets. Major US indices are mixed on Monday, with the banking sector falling sharply. The Dow Jones is at four-month lows levels. The ongoing situation has diminished the odds of a 50 basis points rate hike from the Federal Reserve next week and sent US yields sharply to the downside. On Tuesday, the US will release February’s ConsumerPrice Index, a key input, now being offset by recent developments. Before the SVB collapse, larger-than-expected inflation numbers would have cemented exceptions for a 50bps rate hike, but the case now is more complex with market participants projecting a softer Fed. US yields are falling sharply at a speed not seen in years. The US 10-year was above 4% last week and on Monday bottomed at 3.42%. The slide in yields has weakened the US Dollar against it main European competitors. The DXY is down by almost 1% at the lowest in four weeks.

"USD/JPYis down some 1.3% on the day and has fallen from a high of 135.05 to a low of 132.28 ahead of what will be critical data in the US Consumer Price Index on Tuesday. The US Dollar was pressured at the start of the week and in a continuation to the fallout from the Nonfarm Payrolls. While the Nonfarm Payrolls showed robustjobsgrowth, the rise in the Unemployment Rate and signs of cooling wage inflation sent the greenback lower as investors started to trim bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interestratesas sharply. The United States added 311,000 payrolls in February and the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%. However, a survey of economists polled by Reuters expected the United States to have added 205,000 jobs last month and theunemployment rateto hold steady at 3.4%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% last month after gaining 0.3% in January, below expectations of 0.3%. On Monday, more fuel was added to the fire when markets priced in a Federal Reserve that will slow if not halt its raising of interest rates after US authorities moved to limit the fallout from the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. A new Bank Term Funding Program will offer loans from the Federal Reserve of up to one year to depository institutions, backed by United States Treasuries and other assets these institutions hold. Consequently to all of the above, theUS Dollar index, or DXY, which measures the greenback vs. a basket of major currencies, has dropped heavily benefitting the Yen. DXY has printed a fresh low of 103.484, tracking the fall in short-dated Treasury yields. The two-year note was paying as low as 3.997% at one point in New York trade early in the day. In fact, the yield dropped hard from the week´s highs of 4.534% in the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2008, on track for its biggest three-day decline since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Also supporting the bid in the Yen is the fact that the Fed funds futures have been repriced as traders expect that the Fed's terminal rate will be lower. Investors are now expecting that to come in as low as 4.14% for December which was originally priced above 5% on Friday. Additionally, futures are showing a 21% chance of no hikes in rates from the Federal Open Market Committee when announcements will be made on March 22. A week ago futures were pricing about the same probability of a 50 basis point rate hike by policymakers.

US 10-year Treasury bond yields slumped to the monthly low whereas the two-year counterpart marked above 13.0% daily slump amid a sudden shift in the market’s Fed bets due to the fallout of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the Signature Bank. “The two-year note's yield, which reflects interest rate move expectations, was on track for the biggest one-day drop since October 1987 in the wake of that fateful Black Mondaystockmarket crash,” said Reuters. That said, the Fed Fund Futures suggest the 80 basis points (bps) of rate cuts by the end of 2023, versus a 50 bps rate hike in the next meeting expected previously.

It’s worth noting that news conveying Britain's Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt, as he announces a plan to create 12 ""investment zones"" in England also favors the GBP/USD buyers. “Ahead of Hunt's annual budget on Wednesday, the finance ministry said each of the zones will be backed by 80 million pounds spread over five years that can be directed towards tax relief for businesses, training and infrastructure,” stated Reuters. Looking ahead, the UK employment report will be crucial to watch for immediate directions as the central bank haws retreat. Following that, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February will be important to watch for clear directions. Forecasts suggest a slight reduction in the UK’s Claimant Count Change andUnemployment Ratejostling with a minor fall in the Average Earnings. On the other hand, the US CPI is likely to ease to 6.0% YoY versus 6.4% prior while CPI ex Food & Energy may slide to 5.5% YoY from 5.6% prior. To sum up, the mixed expectations from the UK and the US data join the market’s latest attention on the financial risks and a fall in the Treasury bond yields to dim the importance of today’s economic calendar for the GBP/USD pair traders.

"AUD/USD is treading water in the early Asian session after hitting the 0.6700 mark in the last trading session.US Dollar Index(DXY) is on the softer side in early Asian hours, as the market awaits the United States (US) ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) data release on Tuesday. AUD/USDhas not capitalized much on the previous trading day in wake of the backstop provided by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and US Treasury. On Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) fallout and to cement any dent over the US banking system, the Fed came up with a backstop plan on Sunday, which prompted milderrisk onthe market environment during New York (NY) session on Monday. Looking ahead, the market is heading into US CPI data with caution due to the numerous dynamic changes that occurred on Monday after the SVB fallout event. Many key market forecasters are rolling back their 50 basis points (bps) Fed rate hike expectation for 22 March. Given the fact that higher borrowing cost across the globe is putting pressure on high-leverage business like tech companies, which are struggling to keep on with repayments on their debt amidst higher interest rate, therefore the banking system is facing a big problem with their non-performing assets. Moreover, a continuously rising interest rate will likely hammer the banking system as per the aforementioned analogy. Hence the market is expecting no overstretching on the rate fronts. However, elevated inflation levels are putting central banks into a tricky situation and acting like a double whammy for central banks. The upcoming US CPI will be interesting to watch as it's only going to add more complexity for the Federal Reserve. Levels to watch. AUD/USD  ",0
"TheUSD/JPY pairis displaying back-and-forth action above 133.00 in the Asian session. The asset has shown a recovery move from 132.50 but is struggling to extend gains amid the absence of strength in theUS Dollar Index(DXY) after the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fallout. The loss of confidence of the market participants in the banking system of the United States has trimmed the safe-haven appeal dramatically. S&P500 futures have recovered marginal losses recorded on Monday, indicating mild optimism in themarket sentiment. The USD Index is aiming to recapture the immediate resistance of 103.80, however, the upside looks restricted amid expectations of the continuation of a smaller rate hike spell by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The rollback of 50 basis points (bps) rate hike expectations by the street has impacted the USD Index. Meanwhile, the demand for US government bonds is narrowing again, which could be a recovery move from safe-haven assets. The 10-year US Treasury yields have rebounded to above 3.56%. On Tuesday, the release of the United States ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) data would be a major trigger for the FX domain. Analysts at Wells Fargo expect “Another monthly increase of 0.4% in the overall CPI in February, which would put the annual rate at 6.0%. We still see inflation set to grind lower, but the process is likely to be bumpy and take time. Despite some directional improvement over the past couple of quarters, prices are still growing well above the Fed's 2% target, and the tight labor market suggests that there are still inflationary pressures that could forestall a full return to 2% inflation.” Meanwhile, Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday, they don't see a big impact on Japan's financial companies from the SVB fallout. He further added, “Japan’s financial institutions have sufficientliquidity, capital base overall. “ Going forward, the minutes of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) last monetary policy meeting conducted by ex-BoJ Governor HaruhikoKurodawill be keenly watched, which is scheduled for Wednesday.

"AUD/USD drops to 0.6650, down 0.25% on a day, as traders position themselves for the US inflation data during early Tuesday. The quote’s latest weakness could also be linked to the market’s fears surrounding China and Russia, as well as downbeat data from Australia. That said, the Aussie pair rose the most since early February on the previous day amid broad-based US Dollar weakness. National Australia Bank’s (NAB) sentiment indices for February marked downbeat figures and allowed the AUD/USD bulls to take a breather. It should be noted that the NAB Business Conditions dropped to 17 from 18, versus 21 market forecasts, whereas the NAB Business Confidence nosedived to -4.0 compared to 0.0% analysts’ estimates and 6.0% prior. Elsewhere, US Treasury bond yields print mild gains after falling heavily the previous day. On the same line is the latest minor upside by the S&P 500 Futures. With this, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields seesaw around 3.56%, after bouncing off the monthly bottom of 3.418%, whereas the two-year counterpart bounces off the lowest levels since September 2022 to print mild gains of around 4.05% by the press time. Apart from the market positioning and NAB data, the AUD/USD traders may also have traced the US inflation expectations to rally the previous day, before marking the latest loss. That said, the US inflation expectations per the 10-year and 5-year breakeven inflationratesfrom the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED) dropped to the lowest levels since early February. In doing so, the inflation precursors dropped for the consecutive fifth and sixth days for the five-year and 10-year gauges respectively. Above all, the recent rebound in the US Treasury bond yields allowed the AUD/USD pair to consolidate the gains marked due to the US banking regulators’ defense of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the Signature Bank. Even so, the blow to the Federal Reserve (Fed) bets seems to challenge the AUD/USD bears ahead of the key US ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) data for February. As per the latest updates from Reuters, the US Fed Fund Futures have priced in a 69% chance of a 25-bps hike at next week's Fed policy meeting, with a more than 30% probability of a pause. The market last week was poised for a 50-bps increase prior to the SVB collapse, reported Reuters. On the same line could be the CME as it mentioned, “Traders see 33% chance Fed holds rates this month, market pricing shows rate cuts expected as early as June.” Looking ahead, the US CPI will be important for intraday directions but major attention should be given to the risk catalysts and the yields. That said, the US CPI is likely to ease to 6.0% YoY versus 6.4% prior while CPI ex Food & Energy may slide to 5.5% YoY from 5.6% prior.

"EUR/USD price took a sharp rebound from February's low at 1.0537 and since then it has been aggressively heading higher. The softer US Dollar is driving the EUR/USD above the 1.0700 psychological mark, which is a multi-tested round figure mark on the dailychart. The pair is flirting around the 50-Daily Moving Average (DMA), which is currently pegged around the 1.0727 level, at the time of writing, keeping a lid on further price momentum. Given the fact that the upside for the pair is likely to remain intact until the US Dollar is subdued on the back of falling US Treasury bond yields, any convincing break above the 50-DMA will likely lead the pair toward the next support zone and a key psychological level at 1.0800. On the other side, any downside for EUR/USD will be limited around the previous day’s low at 1.0645, which is also coinciding with 21-DMA. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around the soft ’50s, suggesting further upside room forEUR/USD. Dwindling bets for aggressive rate hiking from Federal Reserve (FED) amid the Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) fallout is likely to keep the US Dollar trajectory to the downside, for time being. The next upcoming event, the US ConsumerPrice Index(CPI), will be key to watch for the pair, as it provides a narrative before heading into the March 22, FOMC meeting. EUR/USD: Daily chart ",1
"USD/JPY clings to mild gains around 133.70 as it snaps a three-day downtrend with a bounce off the one-month low marked the previous day. In doing so, the Yen pair cheers the market’s consolidation of the moves induced by the US actions to tame fears emanating from the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the Signature Bank. Adding strength to the quote’s rebound could be the recent recovery in the US Treasury bond yields after the previous day’s bond market havoc. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields seesaw around 3.56%, after bouncing off the monthly bottom of 3.418%, whereas the two-year counterpart rebounds from the lowest levels since September 2022 to print mild gains of around 4.05% by the press time. It should be noted that the US two-year Treasury bond yields dropped the most since 1987 the previous day while the latest rebound could be a U-turn from the 200-DMA support ahead of important US data. It should be noted that the traders witnessed heavy bond buying the previous day as the US banking regulators rushed to defend the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the Signature Bank after their fallouts. US banking regulators undertook joint actions to tame the risks emanating from SVB and Signature Bank during the weekend.  While announcing the plan, US President Joe Biden noted on Monday that investors in those banks will not be protected and reminded that ""no one is above the law."" However, the US President also vowed to take whatever action was needed to ensure the safety of the US banking system, per Reuters. However, the policymakers from the UK and Europe, as well as some of the Asia-Pacific majors, have ruled out the odds of witnessing a financial crisis at home after the SVB saga, which in turn might have also pleased the USD/JPY buyers of late. Alternatively, receding hawkish Fed bets and downbeat US inflation expectations join the market’s jittery status amid the US-China tensions and SVB talks seem to challenge the USD/JPY buyers.

"The GBP/USD pairhas stretched its correction to near 1.2150 in the Asian session. The corrective move from the round-level resistance of 1.2200 has extended as anxiety among investors is soaring ahead of the release of the United Kingdom labor market data and United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures. S&P500 futures have added more gains as investors are digesting the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVC), portraying an increase in the risk appetite specifically forequities. Maintenance of caution is highly advised as investors have cut their exposure to lenders from New York to Japan dramatically.

TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is struggling to stretch its recovery towards 104.00 as the SVB collapse has limited the odds of higherratesannouncement by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The street is expecting Fed chairJerome Powellto look for a smaller rate hike or halt the rate-tightening spell. Meanwhile, the alpha offered on the 10-year US Treasury yields has rebounded further to 3.57%. Investors are awaiting the release of the US inflation, which could be a major trigger for the USD Index. Analysts at Credit Suisse expect “Core CPI inflation to remain steady at 0.4% MoM in February, causing the YoY reading to tick down to 5.5%. Energy and food prices are likely to moderate, with headline inflation also coming in at 0.4% MoM. A reading in-line with our expectations would be uncomfortably high for the Fed, but still consistent with gradual disinflation this year.” On the Pound Sterling front, the release of the UK Employment data will be of significant importance. As per the consensus, the Claimant Count Change (Feb) will drop by 12.4K, lower than the former release of 12.9K. Three-monthUnemployment Rateis expected to increase to 3.8% from the prior release of 3.7%.

"AUD/USDhits the ceiling on a descending trendline after a rebound from the four-month low at 0.6564. The sharp rebounds came on Monday upon the US Dollar's weakness. Receding bets for a 50-bps Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hike have prompted AUD/USD to surge higher, although the downside bias is likely to remain intact, in a risk-averse environment led by SVB fallout. Any upside momentum for AUD/USD is likely to remain capped at Monday’s high around the 0.6713 mark, which is a support-turned-resistance and coincides with a descending trendline starting from February on a dailychart. A break above will lead the pair to confront the next resistance at around 0.6766 which is pegged with 21-day Moving Average (DMA). Both the 21-DMA and 50-DMA are pegged above the current price level, which is technically exerting overhead price pressure on AUD/USD and also confirming the bearish bias for the pair. Downside support is seen at 0.6560, which is a key support level for the AUD/USD. A convincing break below will likely put the pair in a vacuum without any major support for a long distance. Regarding the said level, the pair has respected it on the last three attempts and AUD/USD looks resilient above that price point. The intermediate support lies at the psychological 0.6500 level.

"The EUR/USD pairis gauging a cushion near the round-level support of 1.0700 in the Asian session. The major currency pair has corrected from 1.0740 after exhaustion in the upside momentum. The shared currency pair is expected to remain on the tenterhooks ahead of the release of the United States ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) data. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has extended its recovery to near 104.00 as investors have trimmed short-liquidation after a sheer sell-off. The rationale behind short unwinding in the USD Index is the anxiety among the market participants for the US inflation, which is likely to be a major trigger ahead. Analysts at CIBC are of the view that “A further increase in prices at thepumpand continued pressure in core categories suggest that prices rose by an uncomfortably fast 0.4% in February. Looking at core (ex. food and energy) categories, shelter prices are set to peak imminently as the typical lags with new leases that are resetting at lower rates kick in, but continued pressure in core services outside of the shelter, in line with the tight labor market, will keep the Fed on a tightening path. S&P500 futures have shown a dramatic recovery in the Asian session after a choppy Monday as investors are anticipating a smaller interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve (Fed) as the catastrophic collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVG) has deepened fears of the US recession. Meanwhile, the return generated on 10-year US Treasury yields has extended above 3.57%. On theEurozonefront, MNI reported that theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) was planning to go ahead with the 50 basis points (bps) rate hike at its upcoming meeting despite sliding market rate expectations amid Silicon Bank Valley turmoil. Considering the fact that, Eurozone inflation is extremely solid and has not softened meaningfully yet.

"USD/JPY rebounded after hitting the monthly low of 132.34. The short covering just comes ahead of the US ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) release. The corrective downfall inUSD/JPYwas started earlier this week on the back of falling US Treasury bond yields. The Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) fallout has prompted investors to revisit their rate-hiking expectations about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) plans to increase interest rates during the March FOMC meeting., which was surging exponentially prior to the last Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) release. When borrowing costs increase, it's natural for highly leveraged businesses to experience pressure in repaying their debts. The recent rise in US Treasury bond yields, which reflects the lendingratesin the US economy, has resulted in a decrease in the value of US government bonds purchased during a low-yield market period. Therefore, the credit side has loosened the original value amid surging yield and aliquiditytrap is emerging among the businesses. Fundamentally, this situation is quite similar to the UK’s bond market incident that happened a while ago, where the pension funds have struggled with liquidity. Since the Fed commentary is muted for further clarity on the underlying US financial ecosystem, investors are refraining to put fresh bets on risky assets. Meanwhile, US Consumer Price Index (CPI) is on the cards. The market is expecting a slightly downbeat CPI release from prior releases on Tuesday. As it is always said “devil in the details”, market participants will likely jump to the service-led inflationary portion, since the Fed has made concerns regarding this in many instances.

"In the view of UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang,GBP/USDcould extend the upside on a more convincing fashion once 1.2440 is cleared. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that ‘the rapid rise has scope to test 1.2145’. We added. ‘The major resistance at 1.2240 is not expected to come into view’. GBP strengthened more than expected as it rose to 1.2200 before closing on a strong note at 1.2183 (1.22%). Further GBP strength appears likely even though it remains to be seen if GBP can clearly break above 1.2240. Support is at 1.2135; a breach of 1.2090 would indicate that the current upward pressure has faded.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (14 Mar, spot at 1.2085), we held the view that theoutlookfor GBP is mixed and we expected it to trade in a broad range of 1.1950/1.2240 for the time being. GBP rose to a high of 1.2200 in NY trade and upward momentum is beginning to build. That said, GBP has to break clearly above 1.2440 before a sustained advance is likely.

The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 11.2K in February when compared to -12.4K expected and -30.3K booked previously. The UK’s average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, arrived at 6.5% 3Mo/YoY in January versus 6.7% last and 6.6% expected while the gauge including bonuses stood at 5.7% 3Mo/YoY in January versus 6.0% previous and 5.7% expected.

"The GBP/USD pair recovers modest intraday losses following the release of the UK monthly employment details and climbs to the top end of its daily range during the early European session on Tuesday. Spot prices, meanwhile, remain below the 1.2200 mark, or a one-month high touched on Monday. The UK Office for National Statistics reported that the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits fell by 11.2K in February as compared to the 12.4 decline anticipated. Adding to this, the previous month's reading was also revised to a fall of 30.3K in the Claimant Count Change from 12.9 estimated originally. Furthermore, the jobless rate held steady at 3.7% during the three months to January against expectations for a modest uptick to 3.8%. This, to a larger extent, helped offset a slowdown in the UK wage growth data and does little pushback against market bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) later this month, which lends some support to the British Pound. That said, a goodish pickup in the US Dollar demand, bolstered by rebounding US Treasury bond yields, acts as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair, at least for the time being. The uptick in the US bond yields comes after the US authorities moved to limit the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SNB) and could further be attributed to some repositioning trade ahead of the US consumer inflation figures. However, expectations that the US central bank will slow, if not halt, its interest rate-hiking cycle in the wake of the strain on the US banking system could keep a lid on any meaningful upside for the US bond yields and hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. Traders might also prefer to wait on the sidelines and await the release of the crucial US CPI report, due later during the early North American session. This week's US economic docket also features theProducer Price Index(PPI) and monthly Retail Sales figures on Wednesday, which should influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus tothe GBP/USD pair.

Spot prices, however, struggle to capitalize on the intraday move up beyond the 0.6670 region and remain below a multi-day top touched the previous day. As the shock from the collapse of three US banks in a week began to recede, a modest recovery in the global equity markets turn out to be a key factor lending some support to the risk-sensitive Aussie. That said, a goodish pickup in the US Dollar demand, bolstered by rebounding US Treasury bond yields, keeps a lid on any meaningful upside for the AUD/USD pair, at least for the time being. The uptick in the US bond yields comes after the US authorities moved to limit the fallout from the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). In fact, the Federal Reserve on Sunday announced that it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors and ease fears of a broader systemic crisis. Apart from this, traders seem reluctant to place aggressive bets and prefer to wait on the sidelines ahead of the release of the key US consumer inflation figures, due later during the early North American session. Given the strain on the US banking system, theFedis now expected to slow, if not halt, its interest rate-hiking cycle. Hence, a stronger USCPIprint might do little to impress the USD bulls. This, in turn, supports prospects for some near-term appreciating move for the AUD/USD pair. That said, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) recent dovish shift, signalling that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, warrants some caution before confirming that spot prices have bottomed out in the near term.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “While we expected USD to weaken yesterday, we did not anticipate the rapid downward acceleration as it plummeted to a low of 132.27 before rebounding (we were of the view that 133.00 was likely out of reach).

We did not anticipate the sharp selloff as USD plunged to 132.27 and then rebounded to close at 133.18 (-1.33%). The sharp increase in downward momentum suggests further USD weakness. The next level to watch is 131.50. On the upside, a breach of 135.10 (‘strong resistance’ level was at 136.40 yesterday) would indicate that USD is not weakening further.”",0
"The GBP/USD pair struggles to capitalize on its modest intraday uptick and trades with a negative bias through the first half of the European session on Tuesday. The pair is currently placed just above the mid-1.2100s, down over 0.15% for the day, and for now, seems to have snapped a four-day winning streak to a one-month peak, around the 1.2200 mark touched on Monday. The British Pound did get a minor lift following the release of the UK monthly employment details, which reaffirmed bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) later this month. That said, resurgent US Dollar (USD) demand, bolstered by a goodish pickup in the US Treasury bond yields, turns out to be a key factor forcing the GBP/USD pair to erode a part of the previous day's strong gains. The Federal Reserve moved to limit the fallout from the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and announced on Sunday that it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. This, in turn, helps ease fears of a broader systemic crisis and is seen pushing the US bond yields higher across the board. The strong intraday USD rally could further be attributed to some repositioning trade ahead of the release of the crucial US consumerinflationfigures, due later during the early North American session. However, speculations that theFedcould slow, if not halt, its rate-hiking cycle, amid the strain on the US banking system, might cap any meaningful upside for the USD and lend some support tothe GBP/USD pair.

"Following Monday's sharp upsurge, GBP/USD has gone into a consolidation phase below 1.2200. Still, economists at ING see upside despite potential hold by theBank of England. Wage growth might have finally peaked “On the data front, data released today show clear signs that wage growth might have finally peaked. The 3M/3M annualised rate of growth has slowed noticeably over recent months. This will be welcome news for the BoE and does question whether the Bank will indeed hike by 25 bps next week amid the SVB fallout.” “Even if the BoE decides to hold, this should not prevent Cable from testing the January 1.2450 highs if theFedpivots to the dovish side and risk sentiment bounces back.” ",1

In comparison, thetwo-year Treasury bond yieldshave moderately increased to approximately4.22%after experiencing a decline to levels not seen since September 2022. It is worth mentioning that the two-year Treasury bond yields had their most significant drop since 1987 on Monday. However, the latest yield increase could indicate a trend reversal before crucial US data release. It is worth noting that traders experienced a significant increase in bond purchasing the previous day following the fallouts ofSilicon Valley Bank (SVB)andSignature Bank. US banking regulators took joint action to mitigate the risks arising from SVB and Signature Bank during the weekend.

"Sterling has drifted a little against the USD. But Cable’s technical patterns lean bullish, economists at Scotiabank report. Loss of support in the mid-1.21s could dump Cable back to the low/mid-1.2000s “Short-term charts show the GBP is well-supported against minor trend support off of last week’s lows in the mid-1.21s and that price action is consolidating in a bull flag pattern (renewed gains above 1.2175 intraday).” “Loss of support in the mid-1.21s could, however, dump the Pound back to the low/mid-1.2000s in rapid order.” “High USinflationdata may give the USD an offsetting lift against the Pound but the near-term trend looks relatively positive in Cable at this point.” ",1

"The USD/JPY broke a range after the beginning of the American session and following the release of US CPI numbers. The pair is trading above 134.70, at daily highs as the US dollar strengthens. Dollar gains momentum, no surprises from consumer inflation US February Consumer Price Indexrose 0.4% in February, as expected, while the annual rate slowed down from 6.4% to 6%. The core CPI rose 0.5%, slightly above the 0.4% of market consensus. The US Dollar stayed relatively quiet immediately after the report. However, the Greenback gained momentum later as US yields moved further to the upside. US Treasurybondsare erasing most of Monday's gains. The rebound in yields is fueling the USD/JPY. ""Inflation has peaked – but that is not news anymore. The issue is that price rises are not falling, just becoming sticky. Moreover, the peak in yearly inflation remains at risk if Core CPI comes out above 0.3%"",explained Yohay Elam, analyst at FXStreet. Just a week ago the question regarding theFedwas 25 or 50bp rate hike. Now is it no change or 25bp. According to the market's response so far to CPI, there still is a chance of a hike. More US inflation data is due on Wednesday with the ProducePrice Index. Also Retail Sales numbers will be released. TheUSD/JPYis erasing Monday's losses and is approaching the 20-day Simple Moving Average (135.40). The intradayoutlookis bullish, however the main picture offers mixed signs.

Fed repricing an opportunity for Euro bulls? “It can be argued that a rebound in EGB yields and further tightening in US/EU spread could elicit further EUR/USD gains.” “The ECB is unlikely to shift down the tightening pace on Thursday following events in the US. A 50 bps rate increase in the depo rate to 3% or 100 bps above the neutral rate is still highly likely. “Guidance in the statement on rates for 2Q (meeting-by meeting?), debate about speeding up of APP QT and updated forecasts for core inflation and wages could be key for rate spreads and the Euro.” “A hawkish press conference could again nudge EUR/USD closer to the highs of early February above 1.08.” ",0
"US inflation remains stubbornly high. With core prices rising at an accelerated pace of 0.5% in February, terminal pricing has moved higher. The repricing in terminal has hit CHF and JPY right off the bat, but the move is set to be short-lived, economists at TD Securities report. Market will place more weighting on financial stability over price stability for now “Consumer price inflation matched expectations in February, with headline CPI advancing at a firm 0.4% MoM pace. However, the real news was in the core segment, with prices there accelerating to 0.5% m/m.” “Importantly, the firmer core CPI reading reflected another robust m/m increase in the services segment, which saw sticky shelter prices as the main culprit. We also expect goods inflation to turn positive again in the near term, adding to upside risks for core price dynamics.” “A stronger read on core has helped to reprice terminal higher, weighing mostly on CHF and JPY given they are most sensitive to this market. That said, we think markets may place more weight on financial over price stability, which may help to cap terminal rate pricing and eventually fade the dip.” ",0

In the 12 months through February, the CPI increased by 6.0%, a slower pace than the 6.4% annualized gain in January, however, this was still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, as such, the US Dollar found some demand on the data and printed the session high in the US but it has since turned lower while futures priced in a Fed rate cut by year's end. Federal Reserve observers are mixed on whether the still solid rise in inflation will push the Fed to raise rates again next week after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank caused turmoil in financial markets. Markets are in anticipation of a terminal rate of 4.45% for December, down from more than 5% last week. Fed funds futures also reveal a change in sentiment with regard to this month's FOMC meeting.

This NAB print suggests business activity is softening and this is a dovish input that implies a potential pause by the RBA. ´´However, we think the Feb Jobs Report released this Thurs is more crucial to the Bank given the Governor's emphasis on preserving job gains,´´ analysts at TD Securities argued. The analysts said that this will be one of the most closely watched employment prints in a long time. ´´The larger-than-usual increase in under-employed people in Jan, and the larger-than-usual rise in the number of unemployed people who had a job to go to in the future suggests a bounce is likely,´´ the analysts said who forecast 47k jobs were added in Feb, the participation rate rising to 66.6%, keeping the Unemployment Rate rate unchanged at 3.7%.

The news also mentioned that UK’s Hunt has dismissed calls from other lawmakers in the ruling Conservative Party for big tax cuts now to boost their fortunes before an election expected in 2024. ""In the autumn we took difficult decisions to deliver stability and sound money,"" Hunt is due to say, according to excerpts of his budget speech. ""Today, we deliver the next part of our plan: A budget for growth,"" he will add reported Reuters. Key quotes Hemmed in by his promise to lower the burden of Britain's 2.5 trillion pounds ($3.0 trillion) of debt, Hunt will seek to tackle some of the causes of Britain's long-term economic funk. Having ruled out a major spending spree or big tax cuts, Hunt will address the acute shortage of candidates for jobs by changing childcare and welfare rules, something he says will help get hundreds of thousands of people back into work. The Guardian newspaper said Hunt would announce a 4 billion-pound childcare expansion for one and two-year olds in England. He is also expected to announce measures to improve skills training and give a green light to 12 investment zones.

The last monetary policy announcement by ex-BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda lacked surprises as a continuation of an ultra-dovish policy stance was highly required to keep inflation steady near desired rates. The commentary in BoJ minutes that the central bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner, indicates that the ultra-loose monetary policy would stay for a longer period.

According to the CME FedWatch tool, around 70% chances are favoring a 25 bps rate hike push to a 4.75-5% interest rate. For further guidance, the release of the US Retail Sales andProducer Price Index(PPI) (Feb) data will be keenly watched. According to the estimates from RBC Economics “US retail sales edged 0.1% lower in February, with sales in the motor vehicle sector shrinking by 3.3% during that month.” Apart from that, the monthly US PPI is expected to expand by 0.3%, lower than the former release of 0.7%. While the annual figure would soften to 5.4% from the prior release of 6%. A decline in the PPI figures would indicate that producers are struggling to expand the prices of goods and services at factory gates due to a decline in the overall demand. Eventually, it would trim the demand for labor and the overall inflation ahead. USD/JPY  ",0

Even if the Aussie pair crosses the 0.6700 round figure, a convergence of the 100-DMA and the 200-DMA, around 0.6770-75 at the latest, appears a tough nut to crack for the bulls.

On the flip side, pullback remains elusive beyond the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the risk-barometer pair’s upside from October 2022 to February 2023, close to 0.6655 by the press time. Following that, the latest swing low and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, also known as the golden Fibonacci ratio, respectively around 0.6565 and 0.6550 in that order, could probe the AUD/USD bears before giving them control. Overall, AUD/USD is likely to witness a pullback as China data looms but the downside room appears limited. AUD/USD: Daily chart  Trend: Pullback expected Additional important levels  ",0
"GBP/USD portrays the typical pre-data anxiety as it seesaws around 1.2150-60 during early Wednesday. That said, the Cable pair traders await the key UK Budget Report, as well as the US Retail Sales for February, amid mixed sentiment and sluggish markets. It should be noted that the mostly mixed UK data and a lack of hawkish bias surrounding the Bank of England (BoE) seem to weigh on the GBP/USD prices amid the cautious mood ahead of an important event. On Tuesday, UK’s headline ILOUnemployment Ratereprinted 3.7% for three months to January versus 3.8% expected whereas the Claimant Count Change improved to -11.2K in February from -30.3K (revised) prior and -12.4K market forecasts. Further details suggest that the Average Earnings Including Bonus matched 5.7% analysts’ estimations for three months to January, versus an upwardly revised 6.0% prior, whereas the ex-Bonus figures came in as 6.5% compared to 6.6% expected and 6.7% previous readings. Following the UK data, the odds of the Bank of England’s (BoE) easy rate hikes, or policy pivot, gained attention. “Growth in pay in Britain - which theBank of Englandis watching closely as it weighs up whether to pause its run of interest rate hikes next week - lost pace in the three months to January, official data showed on Tuesday,” said Reuters. Additionally, the latest survey details from the UK Incomes Data Research (IDR) suggests that British employers agreed on pay rises averaging 5.0% during the three months to the end of January, well above historic norms, and a tight labor market means pay settlements are likely to remain high. On the other hand, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI ex Food and Energy both matched 6.0% and 5.5% YoY market forecasts, versus 6.4% and 5.6% respective previous readings. It should be noted that the market consensus of 0.4% MoM for the CPI, versus 0.5% prior, also proved right but the CPI ex Food & Energy rose to 0.5% compared to 0.4% analysts’ estimates and prior. “The Federal Reserve is seen raising its benchmark rate a quarter of a percentage point next week and again in May, as a government report showed U.S. inflation remained high in February, and concerns of a long-lasting banking crisis eased,” said Reuters following the US inflation data release. Talking about the risks, the US policymakers’ rejections of fears emanating from the latest fallouts of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank seem to help the US Dollar regain its upside bias, especially amid recently firmerFedbets. Late on Tuesday, US Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown and Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman ruled out chatters suggesting the grim conditions of the US banking industry. However, Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that a raft of tougher capital and liquidity requirements are under review, as well as steps to beef up annual “stress tests” that assess banks’ ability to weather a hypothetical recession, according to a person familiar with the latest thinking among U.S. regulators. “The rules could target firms with between $100 billion to $250 billion in assets, which at present escape some of the toughest requirements,” per WSJ. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures remain sidelined despite Wall Street’s upbeat closing. Further, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields grind near 3.68% by the press time, after posting the biggest daily gain in five weeks the previous day, while the two-year bond coupons extend the previous day’s recovery from the six-month low to 4.31% at the latest. Looking ahead, UK Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt will announce the British budget in the Parliament around 12:30 GMT on Wednesday and will be able to propel the GBP/USD prices if matching the upbeat forecasts. Ahead of the event, Reuters quoted the Guardian newspaper as saying that UK Finance Minister Hunt would announce a 4 billion-pound childcare expansion for one and two-year olds in England. The news also added that UK’s Hunt is also expected to announce measures to improve skills training and give a green light to 12 investment zones. Apart from the UK budget, US Retail Sales for February, expected -0.3% MoM versus 3.0% prior, will be important to watch for clear directions. Technical analysis A convergence of the 50-DMA and 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the GBP/USD pair’s upside from November 2022 to February 2023, around 1.2135, joins the bullish MACD signals and upbeat RSI (14), not overbought, to favor the Cable pair buyers.

"EUR/USD is flat on the day so far and trading near 1.0742 and staying within a range of 1.0725 and 1.0742. Overnight, banking stocks surged back andbondsand interest rate futures despite the collapse of some US banks over the past few days. Instead, fears of contagion in the U.S. banking system have reduced and the US Dollar has found its footing again. US CPI supports US Dollar Investors are treading cautiously ahead of next week´s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The US ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) rose 0.4% last month after accelerating 0.5% in January. In the 12 months through February, the CPI increased by 6.0%, a slower pace than the 6.4% annualized gain in January, however, this was still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, as such, the US Dollar found some demand on the data and printed the session high in the US but it has since turned lower while futures priced in a Fed rate cut by year's end. Fed expectations There are mixed sentiments on whether the still solid rise in inflation will push the Fed to raise rates again next week. The banking sector concerns due to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have caused turmoil in financial markets. Markets are in anticipation of a terminal rate of 4.45% for December, down from more than 5% last week. Fed funds futures also reveal a change in sentiment with regard to this month's FOMC meeting. However, the CME´s Fed Watch Tool shows a 28.4% likelihood theFedwould stand pat at the end of its two-day policy meeting on March 22, slightly down from the prior day following the CPI data. Looking ahead, the Europen Central Bank will be key. Analysts at TD Securities explained that they expect the central bank to hike rates by 50bps and drop its one-meeting-ahead forward guidance, emphasizing data dependency from here. ´´But during the press conference,´´ they said, ´´Lagarde is likely to keep a 50bps hike on the table for May's meeting.

"USD/JPYtakes offers to renew intraday low around 134.00 during early Wednesday as the Yen pair sellers reverse the previous day’s corrective bounce off a one-month low. In doing so, the quote justifies the bearish signals from the moving average crossover, as well as the downbeat Relative Strength Index (RSI) line, placed at 14. That said, the 50-SMA prods the 100-SMA from above and joins the downbeat RSI line to suggest the USD/JPY pair’s further declines. However, a five-week-old horizontal support area near 133.90-85 appears a tough nut to crack for the Yen pair bears. In a case where the USD/JPY slips beneath the 133.85 support, the odds of witnessing an extended south-run towards a two-month-old ascending support line, close to 130.55 by the press time, can’t be ruled out. Meanwhile, an area comprising multiple tops marked since February 17, near 135.05-15, restricts immediate USD/JPY upside. Even if the quote traces the bullish MACD signals and crosses the 135.15 resistance, a convergence of the 50-SMA and the 100-SMA, around 135.65-70 by the press time, will be crucial to watch as it holds the key for the USD/JPY run-up towards the monthly high of 137.91.

"Having attended the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) meeting earlier this week, Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) outgoing Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that “there was a debate on SVB collapse mainly around the impact on global markets.” “Participants at BIS meetings appeared relieved to see US authorities act swiftly to contain the damage from the collapse of SVB,” he added. On monetary policy, Kuroda said, BoJ must maintain current monetary easing, but there will also likely be scope to consider steps to address side-effects of easy policy. By maintaining current easy policy, it's possible to sustainably, stably achieve our price target, accompanied by wage growth, while looking after side-effects of our policy. BoJ will surely head for an exit from easy policy and has ability to do so, when 2% inflation target is sustainably, stably met. When BoJ decided to adopt negative rate policy in Jan 2016, my feeling was that many board members were in favor of the idea but some thought doing so at that timing was premature. While it may take some time, expect market function to improve with steps taken under existing market tools. Related reads",0
"The EUR/CHF pair is displaying a back-and-forth action around 0.9860 in the early European session. The cross has turned sideways after a perpendicular upside move and is expected to continue its upside momentum as the debacle of Credit Suisse is stretching further. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has promised an advance of 50bln Swiss Francs to Credit Suisse to support liquidity. However, the commentary from Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann that state assistance ""isn't a topic"" for the bank as it seeks to recover from a string of scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients indicates that the impact will be huge going forward. Meanwhile, investors are keenly awaiting the interest rate decision by the European Central Bank (ECB).ECB President Christine Lagardeis expected to continue its 50 basis points (bps) rate hike spell as Eurozone’s inflation is extremely stubborn. EUR/CHF has delivered a break above the critical resistance plotted from March 13 high at 0.9834 on an hourly scale. This has activated the formation of a Double Bottom chart pattern and has cemented a bullish reversal. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.9839 might continue to provide support to the Euro bulls. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates more upside ahead. Should the asset delivers a mean-reversion to the 20-EMA near 0.9839, a bargain buying opportunity will be triggered, which will drive the cross toward the round-level resistance at 0.9900, followed by October 27 high at 0.9955. In an alternate scenario, a downside break below March 15 low at 0.9706 will drag the asset toward October 12 low at 0.9643 and September 13 low at 0.9584. EUR/CHF hourly chart  EUR/CHF  ",0

"The AUD/USD pair has witnessed sheer buying interest from the market participants and has reached near its weekly high plotted near 0.6720. The Aussie asset has attracted significant bids as investors have lightened their longs in the US Dollar Index (DXY) significantly. The reason behind ignoring the USD Index despite fears of global banking turmoil is the accelerating expectations of a less-hawkish stance on interest rates by the Federal Reserve (Fed) ahead. S&P500 futures have recovered their nominal losses witnessed in Asian morning and has turned positive now. A follow-up buying in the 500-US stocks basket futures after a prominent Thursday indicates a further strengthening of the risk appetite theme. The USD Index has shifted its auction below 104.20 and is expected to deliver more losses, considering that the risk-aversion theme is fading. After breaking above the critical resistance of 0.6668, AUD/USD has soared above 0.6700. At the press time, the Aussie asset is hovering near the weekly high. A bull cross, delivered by the 20-and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 0.6648 indicates more upside ahead. Adding to that, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has shifted into the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates that the upside momentum has been triggered. Should the asset breaks above March 13 high at 0.6717, Aussie bulls would drive the asset further toward March 07 high at 0.67478 followed by the horizontal resistance plotted from February 23 low at 0.6781.

"The AUD/USD pair gains strong follow-through traction for the second successive day on Friday and climbs to a nearly two-week high during the first half of the European session. The pair currently trades just above the 0.6700 round-figure mark and is drawing support from a combination of factors. Multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled banks in the US and Europe ease fears about widespread contagion, which, in turn, boosts investors' confidence. This is evident from a modest recovery in the equity markets, which undermines the safe-haven US Dollar and benefits the risk-sensitive Aussie. Apart from this, expectations that the Federal Reserve will adopt a less hawkish stance in the wake of worsening economic conditions weigh on the buck and provide a goodish lift to the AUD/USD pair. Last week's collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - forced investors to scale back their bets for more aggressive interest rate hikes by theFed. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a smaller 25 bps lift-off at the upcoming FOMC meeting on March 21-22. This leads to a modest downtick in the US Treasury bond yields, which is seen as another factor dragging the USD lower and contributing to the strong bid tone surrounding the AUD/USD pair. Investors, however, remain worried about the possibility of a full-blown global banking crisis. This, along with looming recession risks, should keep a lid on any optimism in the markets and cap the upside for the AUD/USD pair. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) recent dovish shift, signalling that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, warrants some caution for aggressive bullish traders and before positioning for any meaningful near-term appreciating move for the major. Nevertheless, the AUD/USD pair remains on track to end the week on a positive note and reverse a major part of last week's losses to its lowest level since November 2022. Market participants now look to the release of the Michigan US Consumer Sentiment Index for short-term opportunities later during the early North American session on Friday. The focus, however, will remain on the outcome of the highly-anticipated FOMC policy meeting, scheduled to be announced next Wednesday. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0

Last week's collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - forced investors to scale back bets for more aggressive policy tightening by the US central bank. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a smaller 25 bps lift-off the upcoming FOMC meeting on March 21-22, which, along with signs of stability in the financial markets, weigh on the safe-haven Greenback. Multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled banks in the US and Europe ease fears about widespread contagion. This, in turn, boosts investors' confidence, which is evident from a modest recovery in the equity markets. That said, persistent worries about a full-blown global banking crisis keep a lid on the optimism. Furthermore, the Bank of England's (BoE) quarterly survey showed that the median UK public's expectations for inflation for the coming year dropped sharply in February. This reaffirms bets that theBank of England(BoE) will pause its rate-hiking cycle next week and contributes to capping the GBP/USD pair. Market participants now look to the release of the Michigan US Consumer Sentiment Index for short-term opportunities later during the early North American session on Friday. The focus, however, will remain on the key central bank event risks next week - the outcome of the highly-anticipated FOMC policy meeting, scheduled to be announced next Wednesday, followed by the BoE policy meeting on Thursday. Nevertheless, the GBP/USD pair seems poised to register modest weekly gains and remains at the mercy of the USD price dynamics. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
"There is still some chances thatUSD/JPYcould weaken further in the near term, comment UOB Group’s Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that the outlook is mixed and we expected USD to trade in a choppy manner between 132.30 and 134.30. We did not anticipate the sharp drop to 131.71 and the strong bounce from the low (USD closed higher by 0.24% at 133.72). Theoutlookremains mixed and today, we expect USD to trade in a broad range between 132.50 and 134.50.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We continue to hold the same view as yesterday (16 Mar, spot at 133.40) where while there is scope for USD to weaken further, the major support at 131.50 is unlikely to come into view so soon. Note that USD dropped briefly to 131.71 in early NY trade before rebounding strongly. Overall, only a breach of 135.10 (no change in ‘strong resistance’) would indicate that 131.50 is not coming into view.’",0
"TheUSD/JPY pairfails to capitalize on the previous day's solid recovery of over 200 pips from its lowest level since February 14 and comes under some renewed selling pressure on Friday. The pair, however, manages to rebound a few pips from the daily low touched during the early European session and now trades above the 133.00 mark, still down nearly 0.40% for the day. Growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will adopt a less hawkish stance at its upcoming meeting on March 21-22 exerts fresh downward pressure on the US Dollar, which, in turn, is seen weighing on the USD/JPY pair. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a smaller 25 bps lift-off in the wake of last week's collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This leads to a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields and continues to undermine the Greenback. Apart from this, the global flight to safety benefits the Japanese Yen (JPY) and further contributes to the offered tone around the USD/JPY pair. Despite multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled banks in the US and Europe, investors are still trying to determine whether the risk of a full-blown global banking crisis has been tamed and remain concerned about widespread contagion. This, along with looming recession fears, takes its toll on the risk sentiment, which is evident from a softer tone around the equity markets. That said, a more dovish stance adopted by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) should keep a lid on any further gains for the JPY and help limit losses for the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. In fact, the outgoing BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said earlier this Friday that there is room to cut interest rates further into negative territory from the current -0.1%. This, in turn, warrants some caution for aggressive bearish traders and positioning for an extension of the recent downward trajectory witnessed over the past two weeks or so. Market participants now look forward to the release of the Michigan US Consumer Sentiment Index, due later during the early North American session, for short-term trading opportunities. The focus, however, will remain glued to the outcome of the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy meeting, scheduled to be announced next Wednesday. Nevertheless, the USD/JPY pair remains on track to register a third successive week of losses and should continue to take cues from the broader sentiment surrounding the Greenback.

"The AUD/USD pair trims a part of its intraday gains to a nearly two-week high and retreats below the 0.6700 round-figure mark heading into the North American session on Friday. A fresh leg down in the equity markets helps the safe-haven US Dollar to bounce off the daily low and acts as a headwind for the risk-sensitive Australian Dollar. Despite multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled banks in the US and Europe, investors remain worried about widespread contagion and the possibility of a full-blown global banking crisis. This, along with looming recession fears, takes its toll on the global risk sentiment and drives some haven flows towards the Greenback. That said, declining US Treasury bond yields continue to weigh on the USD and remain supportive of the intraday bid tone surrounding the AUD/USD pair. Against the backdrop of the global flight to safety, expectations that theFedwill adopt a less hawkish stance amid the worsening economic conditions drag the US bond yields lower. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a smaller 25 bps rate hike at the upcoming FOMC policy meeting on March 21-22. This comes on the back of last week's collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - and warrants some caution for the USD bulls. Traders, however, might prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of next week's key central bank event risk. In the meantime, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) recent dovish shift, signalling that it might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle, might continue to cap the upside for the AUD/USD pair, at least for the time being. Next on tap is the release of the Michigan US Consumer Sentiment Index. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, might influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair. Nevertheless, spot prices manage to hold in the positive territory for the second successive day and remain on track to end the week on a positive note, reversing a major part of last week's losses to its lowest level since November 2022.

The pair seems to have stabilized at around 1.2150 in the American session and remains on track to end the week in positive territory. Plunging US yields weigh on USD Despite the negative shift witnessed in risk sentiment, the USD is having a difficult time finding demand ahead of the weekend. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond yield is down nearly 5% on the day at around 3.4%, forcing the US Dollar Index (DXY) to stay in the red near 104.00.

More importantly, ""year-ahead inflation expectations receded from 4.1% in February to 3.8%, the lowest reading since April 2021,"" UoM Surveys of Consumers Director, Joanne Hsu, said. Ahead of next week's critical Federal Reserve policy meeting, this report seems to be causing investors to reassess their positions.

"Here is what you need to know for next week Wall Street indexes ended higher a volatile week as traders sail in rough waters. The Nasdaq gained more than 4%, on a bumpy trip. The VIX moderated, rising around 2% over the week, but is up 25% from the level it had a months ago. Banking concerns again dominated price action across financial markets. European and Asian indices closed with weekly losses. What it started a week ago with theSilicon Valley Bank(SVB), continued with Signature Bank, Credit Suisse (that stays on the lookout) and the First Republic Bank. Financial market turbulences will remain centre-stage over the next days. Next Wednesday, the Fed will likely raise interest rates by 25 bps, despite market tensions. If the US central stays on hold afraid of the current context, it could trigger a shock in markets that could offset the positive news of a pause of the tightening cycle. The clues about the future will be watched closely. China on Monday is seen leaving rates unchanged. US Treasurieshad the biggest weekly gains in years. Yields across the globe collapse as investors fly to quality amid rising odds of interest rate cuts before year-end. The Japanese Yen was the main winner among currencies of this context.USD/JPYlost almost 300 pips. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) posted the lowest weekly close in five weeks. The deterioration in market sentiment did not boost the Greenback enough. If systemic risk fears start to dominate price action the DXY could make a strong comeback. TheEuropean Central Bank(ECB) raised interest rates by 50 basis points as expected and dropped forward guidance.

"“Capital, liquidity positions well above APRA’s regulatory requirements,” said Christopher Kent, Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Assistant Governor (Financial Markets). “Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Christopher Kent also said the full impact of increases in interest rates was taking longer to filter through to the economy due to a higher share of fixed-rate mortgages and the savings amassed by households during the pandemic,” reported Reuters. More comments RBA is very conscious of the challenges facing borrowers from rapid rate rises. Household savings amassed during pandemic adding to lag in monetary policy. A wide range of borrowers appear to have built up sizeable mortgage buffers. This means that it's likely to take longer than usual to see the full effect of higher interest rates on household cash flows and household spending. The bank will continue to closely monitor the transmission of monetary policy and its impact on household spending, the labour market and inflation. The Board will respond as necessary to bring inflation back to target in a reasonable time. Volatility in Australian financial markets has picked up but markets are still functioning and, most importantly, Australian banks are unquestionably strong - the banks' capital and liquidity positions are well above regulatory requirements. Australian banks were also well-positioned to repay loans made to them by the RBA during the pandemic, with the first tranche of A$76 billion due between April and September.

Christopher Kent, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets), gave a speech on ""Long and Variable Monetary Policy Lags"" at the KangaNews Debt Capital Market Summit, in Sydney, early Monday morning in Asia-Pacific.

Also read:RBA’s Kent: Australian banks are unquestionably strong Apart from the cautious optimism spread by comments from RBA’s Kent, news that the UBS is up for buying the troubled Credit Suisse also offered a sigh of relief to the market sentiment and propelled the risk-barometer AUD/USD pair.

On Friday, US Consumer Confidence per the University of Michigan's (UoM) Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 63.4 for March versus 67.0 expected and prior. The details suggest that the year-ahead inflation expectations receded from 4.1% in February to 3.8%, the lowest reading since April 2021, while the 5-year counterpart dropped to 2.8% from 2.9% previous reading. Furthermore, US Industrial Production remained unchanged in February versus 0.2% expected and January's 0.3% (revised from 0%) expansion. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed with losses and the US two-year Treasury bond yields dropped the most in three years. Having witnessed the initial market reaction to comments from RBA’s Kent, AUD/USD traders may have to rely on the risk catalysts amid a light calendar on Monday, as well as a cautious mood ahead of the key Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting. It's worth noting that Tuesday’s RBA Meeting Minutes and Thursday’s preliminary readings of Australia’s March month S&P Global PMIs will also be important to observe for fresh impulse.

"USD/JPYlooks to consolidate just above the 131.50 mark amid a jittery environment fueled by the Credit Suisse fallout during the weekend. Finally, Credit Suisse is going to be taken over by UBS as the Swiss authorities persuaded the latter on Sunday to make a bid for a takeover. The news came just after some of the world's top central banks started to offer daily loans in US dollars to their banks to reduce any stress in the financial system. In this globally coordinated response, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has also stepped in along with the Bank of Canada (BoC), Bank of Japan (BoJ), Swiss National Bank (SNB), andthe European Central Bank (ECB). The liquidity injection will be done through swap lines, where central banks can offer US Dollar operations with seven-day maturity. The emergency swap line was first introduced during the COVID pandemic to ease US Dollar availability. Prior to this joint effort, the Fed had already opened the discount window for commercial banks, and the banks have borrowed nearly $164 billion amid this liquidity crisis. As a result, we have seen a slight spike in the Fed balance sheet despite the ongoing Quantitative Tightening (QT) program. One can attribute this as a mini version of QE, which is contrary to the ongoing QT. We have seen the same scenario with theBoEa while ago during the pension fund crisis. It seems contagion in the global banking sectors is not looking to be tamed yet, citing some Reuters reports. At least two major banks in Europe are examining scenarios of contagion in the region's banking sector and are looking to the Federal Reserve and the ECB for stronger signals of support. It's important to note how theFedwill address this entire situation in their upcoming FOMC meeting this week and whether are they able to deliver the expected 25 basis point rate hike.

"The GBP/USD pairis gathering strength is shifting its auction above the round-level resistance of 1.2200 in the Asian session. The Cable has found support as the appeal for the US Dollar Index (DXY) is declining amid rising expectations of a less-hawkish monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed). S&P500 futures are showing significant gains in the Asian session as UOB has confirmed a buyout for Credit Suisse. This has improved the risk appetite of the market participants as investors’ confidence is getting restored. Sky News reported that under the takeover UBS will pay 3bn Swiss francs (£2.6bn) to acquire Credit Suisse. And, it has agreed to assume up to 5bn francs (£4.4bn) in losses, and 100bn Swiss francs (£88.5bn) in liquidity assistance will be available to both banks. The USD Index is observing a restrictive upside around 103.80 as banking shakedown in the United States has faded hawkish guidance delivered by Fed chair Jerome Powell, a few weeks back. Inflation has dropped and the requirement of providing assistance to commercial banks is favoring the need for a lower interest rate hike, just to maintain pressure on stubborn inflation. Analysts at Danske Bank see theFedraising rates by 25 basis points (bps) despite recent turmoil amid banking sector jitters. On the United Kingdom front, investors are awaiting the interest rate decision by theBank of England(BoE), scheduled for Thursday. Analysts at Rabobank also see a quarter-point rate increase and warn that such a scenario is not fully priced in the interest market, “which indicates that the chance of a hold has increased following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).” A 25 bps rate hike by BoE Governor Andrew Bailey would push rates to 4.25%. But before that, UK inflation data will be keenly watched. Annual headline ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) data is expected to decline to 9.8% from double-digit figures. GBP/USD  ",1
"USD/JPY consolidates the biggest weekly loss since January while bouncing off a five-week low to 132.50 during early Monday. In doing so, the yen pair tracks the recovery in the US Treasury bond yields to begin the key week on a firmer footing after marking a three-week losing streak in the last. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields rise six basis points (bps) to 3.49% while the two-year counterpart also adds five bps to print a 3.93% coupon at the latest. It’s worth noting thatUnited Statestwo-year Treasury bond yields marked the biggest weekly loss in three years while the 10-year counterpart dropped the most since early January. As per the latest Bank of Japan (BoJ) Summary of Opinions, the board members saw the need to maintain the ultra-loose monetary policy for now, even as some warned of the need to scrutinize its side effects such as deteriorating market functions. Also read:BOJ board sees the need to maintain easy policy Adding strength to the USD/JPY rebound could be the news shares by Yomiuri saying that the Japanese government eyes efforts worth two trillion Yen to defend the economy from slipping back into the deflation zone. Apart from the likely continuation of the BoJ’s ultra-easy monetary policy, the news suggesting the global central banks’ joint efforts to boost the US Dollar liquidity and the UBS-Credit Suisse deal also allowed the USD/JPY to recover. The Bank of Canada,Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, Federal Reserve, and Swiss National Bank are all up for announcing joint actions to provide more liquidity via standing US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. Further, Sky News reported the news of the UBS-Credit Suisse takeover on Sunday evening while stating that UBS will pay 3 billion Swiss francs (£2.6bn) to acquire Credit Suisse. The news further adds that UBS has agreed to assume up to 5 billion Francs (£4.4bn) in losses, and 100 billion Swiss Francs (£88.5bn) in liquidity assistance will be available to both banks. On the same line were the comments from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) mentioning that the deposits of Signature Bridge Bank will be assumed by a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorporation. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures reverse the previous day’s losses with 0.60% intraday gains around 3,970. Moving forward, the bond market moves will be crucial for theUSD/JPY pairtraders to watch. Additionally important will be Federal Reserve (Fed) action. It should be noted that the Fed is up for a 0.25% rate hike on Wednesday but the rate lift isn’t crucial as it’s mostly priced in. More important is the Fed’soutlookon the banking sector and the US economy, as well as the rate hike trajectory, moving forward. Technical analysis Despite the latest rebound, a daily closing beyond the 50-DMA hurdle surrounding 132.50 becomes necessary for the USD/JPY bulls to retake control. Until then, the Yen pair sellers keep eyes on a nine-week-old upward-sloping support line, near 130.40 by the press time. Additional important levels  ",1

"AUD/USD risk proximity took a leg higher in early Asian trading but retraced after hitting the 0.6730 mark. It is currently trading unchanged.. In the early Asian hours, risk appetite expanded along with some high beta currencies on the back of coordinated efforts from major central banks on the liquidity crunch. Last week we saw many commercial banks starting to fall one by one, with Credit Suisse being among the largest. Swiss authorities urged UBS to acquire the troubled Credit Suisse during the weekend. At the same time, other major central banks like the Federal Reserve (Fed),Bank of England(BoE), European Central Bank (ECB), and Swiss National Bank (SNB) took coordinated efforts to alleviate the liquidity crisis. TheFedhas opened its swap line to supply US Dollars to some major central banks to ease any liquidity drain on the US Dollar front, as it is the world reserve currency. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains isolated from this dollar bidding program, citing no financial stress evidence yet. That being said, two European commercial banks are under scrutiny for liquidity contagion, which could be a possible reason for investors to become cautious despite the swap line. On the other side, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) kept its benchmark rate unchanged as they had already cut the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) by 25 bps on Friday. The consistent easing from PBoC is widening the yield differential with others and is likely to keep capital outflows intact. Some earlier comments from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Christopher Kent stated that the bank would consider financial conditions for the next policy meeting but downplayed the current scenario by saying it's just a small number of poorly managed banks. All eyes are set on the FOMC meeting if they are still to deliver a 25 basis point (bps) rate hike, and if yes, what will be the forward guidance? The most likely scenario could be a done deal, but be ready for any surprise. Levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0
"TheUSD/JPY pairhas corrected sharply below 132.00 in the Asian session. The appeal for the Japanese Yen as a safe-haven has improved amid potential fears of global banking turmoil led by rising interest rates by western central banks. S&P500 futures have turned negative after surrendering significant gains generated in the early morning session, portraying extremely negative market sentiment, despite UBS rescuing Credit Suisse. Bloomberg reported Finma Chief Urban Angehrn says US regulators support the UBS deal to buy Credit Suisse for $3.3 billion. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is struggling to sustain above the 103.80 resistance. It seems that forward anxiety ahead of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy is missing from the market. USD/JPY is declining toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement (placed from January 16 low at 127.22 to March 08 high at 137.91) at 131.30 on a four-hour scale. The declining 10-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 132.35 indicates that the downside momentum is extremely strong. Adding to that, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has slipped into the bearish range of 20.00-40.00, which promises weakness further. It seems that the downside pressure would continue if the asset will surrender last week’s low at 131.55. An occurrence of the same would drag the asset toward January 23 high around 130.89 followed by February 10 low at 129.80. In an alternate scenario, a break above the 38.2% Fibo retracement at 133.83 would strengthen the US Dollar bulls. This might drive the asset toward March 15 high at 135.11 and February 28 low at 135.73. USD/JPY four-hour chart  USD/JPY  ",0
"GBP/USD is doing some serious attempts for recapturing the round-level resistance of 1.2200 in the early European session. The major is oscillating in a narrow range of 1.2168-1.2203. The Cable is struggling to deliver decisive action and is showing a subdued performance as investors are awaiting interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and theBank of England(BoE), which will be announced on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. S&P500 futures are displaying sheervolatility. The 500-US stocks basket has surrendered its entire gains generated in early Asia. It seems that UBS’s rescue plan for Credit Suisse has failed to cheer market participants. Credit Suisse shareholders were deprived of a vote on the deal and will receive one share in UBS for every 22.48 shares they own, valuing the bank at $3.15bn (£2.6bn), as reported by BBC News. Various central banks have come forward to provide liquidity assistance to rescue the second-largest Swiss bank in order to revive the confidence of consumers. The announcement of liquidity assistance to revive the 164-year-old bank has impacted demand for US governmentbonds. The 10-year US Treasury yields have scaled above 3.42% as higher liquidity flush could propel inflationary pressures again. Key event of the week- Federal Reserve policy The whole arena would go through nail-biting moments as the Federal Reserve (Fed) would announce its March monetary policy in times when fears of banking turmoil are deepening sharply. It seems unrealistic that Fed chair Jerome Powell would undermine the potential banking meltdown and will only focus on bringing down the stubborn inflation. Federal Reserve policymakers are delighted with the fact that January’s inflation data was a one-time blip as February’s inflation indicators displayed the continuation of inflation softening. Therefore, the Federal Reserve would be relieved even if it announces second 25 basis points (bps) interest rate hike. In a recent poll by Reuters, 76 of 82 economists believe that the US Federal Reserve would raise its policy rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.75-5% following the March Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. BoE to choose from a dismal economic outlook and double-digit inflation Unlike other economies, the United Kingdom has been facing issues with a dismaleconomic outlook, political instability along with persistent inflationary pressures. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey remained in a fix last year in choosing between growth and inflation. Shortages of labor and higher food inflation have remained major supporters of rampant inflation. No doubt, the Bank of England has been restricting its monetary policy to bring down the galloping inflation. The interest rate has already reached 4%. However, fresh concerns of the global banking fiasco are expected to add to more troubles for the Bank of England policymakers. Therefore, the street is not convinced about further rate hikes for now. Analysts at Rabobank also see a quarter-point rate increase and warn that such a scenario is not fully priced in the interest market, “which indicates that the chance of a hold has increased following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).” A 25 bps rate hike by BoE Governor Andrew Bailey would push rates to 4.25%. The action from the Pound Sterling would not be restricted to the monetary policy from the Bank of England. Wednesday’s ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) data is going to drive the Bank of England’s decision-making ahead. As per the estimates, the annual headline CPI is expected to trim to 9.8% from the former release of 10.1%. While the core CPI that excludes oil and food prices would remain steady at 5.8%. GBP/USD technical outlook  GBP/USD has witnessed a solid upside move after testing the breakout zone of the Falling Channel chart pattern formed on a daily scale. The Cable is approaching the horizontal resistance plotted from December 14 high at 1.2447. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2080 is providing cushion to the Pound Sterling bulls.

"Here is what you need to know on Monday, March 20: Financial markets started the new week on a cautious note despite the weekend's encouraging headlines regarding the global liquidity issues. Eurostat will release January Trade Balance data later in the session and Germany's Bundesbank will publish its monthly report. European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde will testify before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) of the European Parliament in Brussels at 14 GMT. Late Sunday, Swiss authorities persuaded UBS Group AG to buy Credit Suisse Group AG in the next step to try and stop the spread of the banking crisis. UBS will reportedly pay $3.23 billion for Credit Suisse and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses in a deal that is expected to close by the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve (Fed) announced that it will offer daily swaps to the Bank of Canada (BoC), the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the European Central Bank (ECB) to ensure they have enough liquidity to continue operations. ""The network of swap lines among these central banks is a set of available standing facilities and serve as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets,"" the Fed said in a statement published on Sunday. Despite these developments, US stock index futures were last seen losing between 0.7% and 1% on the day. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond yield is down more than 3% on the day at 3.3% and the US Dollar Index trades modestly lower on the day below 104.00. AlthoughEUR/USDopened with a bullish gap and rose above 1.0700 to start the week, it lost its traction and retreated toward 1.0650 in the early European morning.

GBP/USDtouched its highest level since mid-February above 1.2220 in the Asian session on Monday. The pair, however, reversed its direction and declined below 1.2200, retracing the majority of its daily gains in the process.

"With theECBlikely to act more restrictively overall, economists at Commerzbank see the Franc moderately weaker against the EUR over the course of the year. EUR/CHF could remain below parity for the time being “If the Franc weakens too much, foreign exchange interventions by the SNB are likely against the backdrop of the recent inflation development in Switzerland. In the short term, EUR/CHF could therefore remain below parity for the time being.” “In the medium term, however, we see the CHF weakening moderately. This is because the ECB is likely to raise its key rate more than the SNB by the middle of the year, and since price pressures in Switzerland are likely to ease at the same time, theSNBshould allow the Franc to weaken moderately against the EUR.”  Source: Commerzbank Research ",0

"In the opinion of Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group, sustainable gains inGBP/USDlook likely once the pair clears the 1.2220 level. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted last Friday that ‘Mild upward pressure could lead to GBP edging higher but a sustained advance above 1.2150 is unlikely’.  The anticipated advance exceeded our expectations as GBP soared to 1.2201 before closing on a firm note at 1.2181 (+0.58%). While GBP could advance further, a sustained rise above 1.2220 appears unlikely. Support is at 1.2155, followed by 1.2125.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our latest narrative was from last Thursday (16 Mar, spot at 1.2075) where GBP is likely to trade in a broad consolidation range, expected to be between 1.1950 and 1.2190. GBP edged slightly above 1.2190 on Friday (high of 1.2201) and upward momentum is beginning to build. However, GBP has to break and stay above 1.2220 before a sustained rise is likely (the next resistance is at 1.2270). The risk of GBP breaking clearly above 1.2220 will remain intact as long as it stays above 1.2095 in the next few days.”",1

The inconclusive price action around the pair falls within the equally vacillating mood around the greenback and the rest of the global assets in a context where market participants remain prudent in light of the developments around the banking sector and the imminence of the FOMC gathering.

What to look for around EUR EUR/USD’s intentions to extend the rebound seem to have met some resistance around the 1.0700 zone for the time being. In the meantime, price action around the European currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the potential next moves from the ECB in a context still dominated by elevated inflation, although amidst dwindling recession risks for the time being.

"TheUSD/JPY pairretreats over 200 pips from the daily swing high and drops to its lowest level since February 10 during the first half of the European session on Monday. Spot prices, however, manage to rebound a few pips in the last hour and currently trades around the 131.00 mark, still down over 0.60% for the day. The prevalent risk-off environment - as reflected by an extended sell-off around the equity markets amid fears of a full-blown banking crisis - drives some haven flows towards the Japanese Yen (JPY) and weighs heavily on the USD/JPY pair. Despite the recent emergency liquidity measures and multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled US and European banks, market participants remain concerned about the contagion risk. This, along with looming recession risks, takes its toll on the global risk sentiment and forces investors to take refuge in traditional safe-haven assets. That said, a modest US Dollar (USD) strength assists the USD/JPY pair to find some support ahead of the mid-130.00s and stall its sharp intraday downfall. The USD uptick, however, remains limited amid the ongoing slump in the US Treasury bond yields. The anti-risk flow, along with diminishing odds for a more aggressive policy tightening by the Fed, lead to a further steep fall in the US bond yields. This comes after the rate-sensitive 2-year US government bond last week recorded its biggest three-day fall since Black Monday in October 1987 and should cap the buck. The aforementioned fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the USD/JPY pair is to the downside. That said, traders might refrain from placing fresh bearish bets and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the two-day FOMC meeting, starting this Tuesday. TheFedwill announce its policy decision during the US session on Wednesday, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics.

The pair trades just below the 1.2200 mark through the first half of the European session and remains at the mercy of the US Dollar (USD) price dynamics. The prevalent risk-off mood - as depicted by a weaker tone around the equity markets - drives some haven flows towards the Greenback and acts as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. Despite the recent emergency liquidity measures and multi-billion-dollar lifelines for troubled US and European banks, market participants remain concerned about the contagion risk and the possibility of a full-blown global banking crisis. This, in turn, continues to weigh on investors' sentiment and benefits traditional safe-haven assets, including the USD. That said, the ongoing slump in the US Treasury bond yields, amid diminishing odds for a more aggressive policy tightening by theFed, keeps a lid on any further gains for the USD and continues to lend support to the GBP/USD pair. Investors now seem convinced that the US central bank will soften its hawkish rhetoric, especially after the recent collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

"The AUD/USD pair struggles to capitalize on its modest intraday gains and retreats from a nearly two-week high, around the 0.6730 area touched earlier this Monday. Spot prices, however, manage to rebound a few pips from the daily low and trade just below the 0.6700 round-figure mark heading into the North American session. A solid rebound in the US equity futures turns out to be a key factor lending some support to the risk-sensitive Aussie amid the emergence of fresh selling around the US Dollar. Against the backdrop of a modest recovery in the global risk sentiment, a further slide in the US Treasury bond yields exerts some downward pressure on the safe-haven Greenback and acts as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair. The recent collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - forced investors to scale back bets for a more aggressive policy tightening by the US central bank. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a smaller 25 bps lift-off at the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy meeting, starting this Tuesday, which continues to drag the US bond yields lower. It is worth mentioning that the rate-sensitive 2-year US government bond last week recorded its biggest three-day slump since Black Monday in October 1987. This keeps the USD bulls on the defensive and helps limit the downside for the AUD/USD pair. That said, concerns about the contagion risk and the possibility of a full-blown global banking crisis could cap any optimism in the markets. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) monetary policy meeting minutes, due during the Asian session on Tuesday.

GBP retains a firm undertone “Sterling is making another run at 1.22-plus levels and looks to have some decent (short-term) momentum under it.” “The Pound has found solid support on significant dips in the recent past and looks to have a good chance of holding and extending gains through the 55-Day Moving Average (1.2132) this week and push on to test major resistance (1-year downtrend) at 1.2290/00 in the coming days.” ,1
"USD/JPYis expected to accelerate losses on a breakdown of 131.50, comment Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group. Key Quotes 24-hout view: “Last Friday, we expected USD to trade in a broad range between 132.50 and 134.30. However, from a high of 133.83, USD plummeted to a low of 131.55 before rebounding. The rebound amid oversold conditions suggests USD is unlikely to weaken further. Today, USD is more likely to trade sideways between 131.70 and 133.20.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have expected USD to weaken since the start of last week. In our latest narrative from last Thursday (16 Mar, spot at 133.40), we indicated that while there is scope for USD to weaken further, the major support at 131.50 is unlikely to come into view so soon. On Friday, USD dropped to 131.55 before rebounding. Despite the relatively sharp drop, there is no significant increase in momentum. We continue to hold a negative USD view but it has to break and stay below 131.50 before a move towards the next support at 130.45 is likely. The downside risk is intact as long as USD does not move above 133.80 (‘strong resistance’ level previously at 135.10).”",0
"EUR/USDclimbs to 3-day highs past 1.0700 the figure and extends the rebound for the third consecutive session on Monday.

"The GBP/USD pair builds on last week's rally from the vicinity of the 1.2000 psychological mark and gains positive traction for the third successive day on Monday. The momentum remains uninterrupted through the early North American session and lifts spot prices to over a one-month high, around the 1.2240 region in the last hour. An intraday turnaround in the global risk sentiment - as depicted by a solid recovery in the US equity futures - drags the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) to its lowest level since February 14, which, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair. The USD is further pressured by diminishing odds for a more aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed), especially after the recent collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. In fact, the markets are now pricing in a smaller 25 bps lift-off at the end of a two-day FOMC monetary policy meeting, starting this Tuesday. The US central bank is also expected to start cutting interest rates during the second half of the year, which had led to the recent sharp downfall in the US Treasury bond yields. It is worth recalling that the rate-sensitive 2-year US government bond last week recorded its biggest three-day slump since Black Monday in October 1987. That said, some repositioning trade ahead of the key central bank event risk pushes the US bond yields high, albeit does little to impress the USD bulls. This, along with the possibility of some short-term trading stops being triggered above the 1.2200 mark, further contributes to the bid tone surrounding the GBP/USD pair. It, however, remains to be seen if the intraday positive move is backed by genuine buying or turns out to be a stop run, warranting some caution for bulls. In the absence of any major market-movingeconomic dataon Monday, the focus will remain glued to the FOMC decision on Wednesday and theBank of Englandpolicy meeting on Thursday. Apart from this, traders, this week will confront the release of the latest consumer inflation figures from the UK on Wednesday. The crucial macro data, along with the highly-anticipated central bank meetings, will help to determine the near-term trajectory forthe GBP/USD pair. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
EUR/USD is starting the week on a firm note. Economists at Scotiabank expect the pair to rise if the Fed blinks at its Wednesday's monearty policy decsion. More range trading seems the likely course of events for now “More range trading seems the likely course of events for now but the EUR will benefit if theFedblinks on Wednesday after theECBdelivered last week.” “Weak trend momentum on the short (intraday/daily) DMIs suggests that the roughly sideways Feb/Mar range in the EUR should extend a little more – with EUR gains slowing above 1.07.” “We see firm resistance around 1.0750/60 for now.” “Support is 1.0625/30 intraday.” ,1
"TheUSD/JPY pairfinds decent support in the vicinity of the mid-130.00s and stages a goodish intraday recovery of over 100 pips from its lowest level since February 10 touched earlier this Monday. The pair, however, keeps the red for the second straight day and trades just above the 131.50 region during the early North American session, down less than 0.15% for the day. From a technical perspective, the intraday failure near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally from the January monthly swing low exerts heavy pressure on the USD/JPY pair amid the emergence of fresh US Dollar selling. That said, spot prices struggle to find bearish acceptance below the 61.8% Fibo. level amid an intraday turnaround in the global risk sentiment, which tends to undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY). Apart from this, the Fed-Bank of Japan (BoJ) policyoutlookturns out to be another factor that assists the USD/JPY pair to attract some buyers at lower levels. Traders also opt to lighten their bearish bets ahead of the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy meeting, starting this Tuesday. TheFedwill announce its decision on Wednesday, which will drive the USD demand and help determine the next leg of a directional move for the major. In the meantime, any subsequent recovery is more likely to confront some resistance near the 132.00 mark ahead of the 50% Fibo. level, around the 132.60-132.65 region. A sustained move beyond has the potential to lift the USD/JPY pair back towards the 133.00 round figure en route to the next relevant hurdle near the 133.50 region. This is closely followed by 38.2% Fibo. level, around the 133.80 zone, which should now act as a pivotal point. On the flip side, the daily swing low, around the 130.55-130.50 region, now seems to protect the immediate downside. Some follow-through selling will confirm a bearish breakdown and make the USD/JPY pair vulnerable to challenging the 130.00 psychological mark. The downward trajectory could get extended towards intermediate support near the 129.55-129.50 area en route to the 129.00 round figure and the 128.50 horizontal zone.

The Federal Reserve is focused on inflation and will look to hike 25 bps if conditions allow. Economists at ING analyze how Wednesday’s meeting could impact the US Dollar. A pause could see the Dollar weaken a little “We do not expect too muchvolatilityif conditions allow theFedto hike 25 bps and the dot plots do not surprise too much.” “An unlikely 50 bps hike would be very bullish for the Dollar – and EUR/USD could well trade under big support at 1.05 on the news.” “A pause could see the Dollar weaken a little – but it would be understandable after recent bank failures.” ,1

Indeed, concerns around the banking sector in the old continent appear somewhat alleviated in response to news involving UBS and Credit Suisse, although this does not prevent shares of the latter to shed nearly 60% at the beginning of the week. Looking at the bigger picture, the better tone in the risk complex helps the cross regain the 0.9900 barrier and beyond and clinch fresh 2-week tops against the backdrop of another negative session in the greenback.

An improvement in market mood and European Central Bank (ECB) speakers lend a hand to the Euro (EUR), while the US Dollar (USD) continues to weaken across the board. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD is trading at 1.0720. Germany’s PPI and ECB speaking among the factors boosting the Euro Market sentiment improved after UBS bought its Swiss rival Credit Suisse. The financial market turbulence has spurred speculations that global central banks could pause the pace of tightening. However, traders expect a 25 bps rate hike by the Federal Reserve (Fed) on Wednesday. The CME FedWatch Tool odds for a quarter of a percentage point lift at 73.10%. The EUR/USD price action has been driven by ECB speakers. ThePresident of the ECB,Christine Lagarde, said that inflation is expected to continue excessively high for a more extended period.

EUR/USD Technical analysis The EUR/USD has printed three consecutive bullish candles, though it remains shy of testing last week’s high of 1.0759. The daily chart suggests a triple bottom is in place, though it would need to reclaim the latter to confirm its validity. That would pave the way for a rally towards the YTD high of 1.1032, but firstly, traders need to clear the February 14 at 1.0804 before aiming towards 1.1000.

"AUD/USD prints a leg-up above the 0.6700 figure, helped by an improvement in market sentiment. Investors shrugged off banking crisis contagion woes after UBS decided to buy Credit Suisse, perceived by traders as an excuse to buy riskier assets. That, alongside speculations for less aggressive monetary policies amongst central banks, weighed on the US Dollar. At the time of writing, the AUD/USD exchanges hands at 0.6715.

On the Australian front, the lack of data left traders adrift to risk appetite. Even though China’s reopening should bolster the Australian Dollar (AUD), the latest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), was perceived as a dovish one, which would exert downward pressure on the AUD/USD.

"The EUR/USD pairis displaying a sideways performance around 1.0720 in the early Asian session. The major currency asset is expected to extend its journey toward the critical resistance of 1.0750 ahead. The shared currency pair has registered a three-day winning streak and is expected to extend further as investors are skeptical about the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed), which is scheduled for Wednesday. A late recovery in S&P500 allowed it to settle Monday’s session on a decent positive note. It seems that investors cheered the collaborative efforts made by various financial institutions to rescue the First Republic after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. The recovery move byUnited Statesequities is portraying a decent attempt for bulls to settle their feet. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is expected to settle on a negative note consecutively for the third time as investors are still ambiguous about Fed’s monetary policy. As per the CME Fedwatch tool, more than 76% odds are in favor of a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate hike, which would push rates to 4.75-5.00%.

" AUD/USD portrays the market’s cautious optimism, as well as cheers the broad US Dollar weakness, as it seesaws near the highest levels in two weeks during early Tuesday morning in Canberra. That said, the Aussie pair makes rounds to 0.6715-20 after rising in the last three consecutive days. The Aussie pair’s latest gains could be linked to the market’s easing fears of the banking sector collapse, as well as the cautious optimism showed by Christopher Kent, Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Assistant Governor (Financial Markets). Adding to the quote’s upside momentum could be the upbeat performance of Gold and softer Treasury bond yields, which in turn exerted downside pressure on the US Dollar. That said, RBA’s Kent spoke a speech on ""Long and Variable Monetary Policy Lags"" at the KangaNews Debt Capital Market Summit, in Sydney, early Monday morning, while saying that the Australian banks are unquestionably strong. The policymaker also said that RBA is very conscious of the challenges facing borrowers from rapid rate rises. Elsewhere, news of UBS’ takeover of the troubled Credit Suisse, by paying 3 billion Swiss francs (£2.6bn), also eased the market’s fears. On the same line were statements from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) mentioning that the deposits of Signature Bridge Bank will be assumed by a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorporation. Furthermore, around five major banks joined the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to ease the US Dollar liquidity crunch via currency swaps and added strength to the market’s risk-on mood. “The Bank of Canada,Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, Federal Reserve, and Swiss National Bank are all up for announcing joint actions to provide more liquidity via standing US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements,” said Reuters. It should be noted, however, that a Senior Swiss lawmaker warned on Monday that “the UBS-Credit Suisse merger is an enormous risk,” which in turn probed the optimists amid the market’s anxiety ahead of this week’s top-tier data/events. Against this backdrop, the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped to the lowest levels in a month while the US Treasury bond yields stays pressured. Further, Wall Street closed on the positive side whereGold pricerefreshed Year-To-Date (YTD) high before retreating to $1,980 at the latest.

"TheUSD/JPYclosely follows the short end of the US Treasury (UST) yield curve, as diminishing demand for the US Dollar weighs on the pair. This comes amid speculation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may not pursue aggressive rate hikes as anticipated due to the recent banking turmoil. On Monday, the US dollar weakened as investors responded to UBS's acquisition of its struggling competitor, Credit Suisse, for CHF 3 billion. Following the global banking crisis, the US Dollar is losing its safe-haven status, while the Japanese Yen has regained its conventional safe-haven status. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this month sent shockwaves through the markets, causing a plunge in banking stocks and concerns that central bank monetary tightening could lead to a recession. In response to the ongoing banking crisis, the Fed has opened swap lines to other central banks to provide US Dollar liquidity. This move may contribute to the downward pressure on US Dollar demand. Investors are cautiously watching the Fed's decision on Wednesday's conclusion of a two-day meeting. Before the banking turmoil, many market participants had expected a 50 basis point (bps) interest rate hike from the Fed at its March meeting. However, Fed funds futures now indicate a 28.4% probability of the Fed maintaining its overnight rate at 4.5%-4.75%, and a 71.6% likelihood of a 25 bps increase, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.

Last week, the GBP fell in response to Wednesday's shift into the USD (and out of EUR), but the low price found support from buyers at its 200-hour moving average. On Thursday, the price briefly dipped below its 100-day moving average (blue step line on the chart above) but was unable to maintain downward momentum towards the 200-hour MA. Consequently, sellers turned into buyers. On Friday, most of the price action remained above the 100-hour moving average (higher blue line), keeping buyers in control. Taking a broader look at the daily chart, the next key targets come between and 1.2259 and 1.2269. Those levels include the low from January 24, the high from February 3 in the high from February 14.",1

Traders focused risk could use the area to sell, with a stop above.  Hold resistance and fall back below 1.22608, could see a rotation back toward 1.22028 as a downside target.",1
"GBP/USD dribbles around a six-week high, making rounds to 1.2270-80 during early Tuesday, as the banking crisis challenges theBank of England(BoE) hawks. Also testing the Cable pair buyers are the looming fears of anotherBrexitdisappointment, despite UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s hard efforts to strike a deal over the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP). The Telegraph conveys multiple analysts’ estimations while saying, “The Bank of England (BoE) will be forced to abandon an interest rate rise this week following turmoil in global financial markets.” The forecasts become too important ahead of the “Super Thursday” as some on the floor expected a 50 bps rate hike from the “Old Lady”, as the BoE is casually known. On the other hand, BBC News quotes Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson as saying that the agreement was not sufficient to deal with concerns that his party had raised about post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland. “The DUP has confirmed that it will oppose the deal - known as the Windsor Framework - when MPs are given a vote on part of it on Wednesday,” adds BBC News. Elsewhere, hopes of easing the banking crisis seem to have favored the market sentiment and drowned the US Dollar. UBS’ takeover of the troubled Credit Suisse, by paying 3 billion Swiss francs (£2.6bn), eased the market’s baking fears. On the same line were statements from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) mentioning that the deposits of Signature Bridge Bank will be assumed by a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorporation. Additionally, news that five major banks, including the BoE, joined the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to ease the US Dollar liquidity crunch via currency swaps and added strength to the market’s risk-on mood. It should be noted, however, that a Senior Swiss lawmaker warned on Monday that “the UBS-Credit Suisse merger is an enormous risk,” which in turn probed the optimists amid the market’s anxiety ahead of this week’s top-tier data/events. Against this backdrop, the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped to the lowest levels in a month while the US Treasury bond yields stays pressured. Further, Wall Street closed on the positive side whereGold pricerefreshed Year-To-Date (YTD) high before retreating to $1,980 at the latest. Moving on, Cable traders should keep their eyes on the risk catalysts for fresh impulse ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting and Thursday’s top-tier outcomes from the Bank of England.

Looking back to February 27 through March 7, the price bottomed in that area before breaking lower on March 7 on its way to its low price which was reached on March 10 at 0.65634. Admittedly the price has traded above that the old swing area on a number of occasions last week as market volatility led to extensions to the upside that for the most part failed. Earlier today there was a failure on the top side as well. However with the price back above that swing area (and the 100 hour moving average finding willing buyers as well), the buyers are more in control. The high price earlier today reached a 0.67295 and remains the next key target. Above that is the 50% midpoint at 0.67417. Risk for traders looking for more upside is the swing area down to 0.66910.

Monetary policy was already in restrictive territory and theeconomic outlookwas uncertain. Members ""agreed to reconsider the case for a pause at the following meeting, recognising that pausing would allow additional time to reassess the outlook for the economy,"" according to the minutes. The Board reiterated that further tightening of the monetary would likely be required given inflation was still too high, the labor market tight and business surveys showed solid activity. The RBA noted that recent data releases on Gross Domestic Product, jobs, wages and inflation, had come in softer than expected, but the shortfalls to expectations were not large. The Board said they would be watching upcoming releases on employment, inflation, retail trade and business surveys, as well as the developments in the global economy at the April meeting. AUD/USD update  GovernorPhilip Loweearlier this month said the central bank was closer to pausing its rate increases as policy was now in restrictive territory, and suggested a halt could come as soon as April depending on the data. Why it matters to traders? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) publishes the minutes of its monetary policy meeting two weeks after the interest rate decision is announced. It provides a detailed record of the discussions held between the RBA’s board members on monetary policy and economic conditions that influenced their decision on adjusting interest rates and/or bond buys, significantly impacting the AUD. The minutes also reveal considerations on international economic developments and the exchange rate value.",1
"The AUD/USD pair has slipped to near 0.6705 amid the release of the less hawkish Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes. The Board reiterated that further tightening of the POLICY would likely be required given inflation was still too high, the labor market tight and business surveys showed solid activity. RBA policymakers considered only a 25 basis points (bps) rate hike as a viable option for March’s monetary policy. Investors should be aware of the fact that RBA GovernorPhilip Lowehiked its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 bps consecutively for the fifth time to 3.60%. Also, it was the 10thconsecutive interest rate hike by the RBA in its battle against stubborn inflation. Recent upbeat Australian employment figures have conveyed that the fight against sticky inflation is extremely complicated and RBA policymakers are still required to take tough decisions in times when inflation uncertainty has joined fears of a global banking meltdown. S&P500 futures have extended Monday’s gains in the Asian session as investors have ignored the fears associated with upcoming monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed), portraying further enhancement in the risk appetite of the market participants. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has continued to remain sideways around 103.30 as investors are anticipating a less hawkish monetary policy and interest rate guidance. After the collapse of three mid-sizeUnited Statescommercial banks,Fedchair Jerome Powell is required to revive the confidence of investors, which could be done by mild tweaks to the interest rate policy. Meanwhile, the demand for US government bonds has weakened further as the collaborative effort of various central banks of providing liquidity assistance in the form of US Dollars for supporting commercial banks has escalated inflation expectations. This has led to a rise in the returns offers on US Treasurybonds. The 10-year US Treasury yields have jumped to 3.5%. AUD/USD  ",0
"AUD/USD prints the first daily loss in four around 0.6700 during early Tuesday morning in Europe as the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) challenges the buyers. Even so, the Aussie pair’s successful trading beyond the previous resistance line from early February, near 0.6625 by the press time, join the bullish MACD signals to keep the buyers hopeful. That said, a clear upside break of the 21-EMA, around 0.6720 by the press time, could direct the AUD/USD buyers towards the 0.6780-85 resistance confluence including 100-EMA, 50-EMA and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of October 2022 to February 2023 upside. Hence, the AUD/USD pair appears to remain sidelined between 0.6780-85 resistance and 0.6625 resistance-turned-support line. It should be noted that a sustained break of 0.6785 could aim for the mid-February high surrounding 0.7030 wherein the 0.7000 round figure and early February’s low of 0.6855 may act as buffers. Alternatively, a downside break of the stated trend line support, previous resistance around 0.6625, may aim for the 0.6600 round figure before approaching the monthly low of 0.6564. Even if the quote drops below 0.6564, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, also known as the golden Fibonacci ratio, could challenge the AUD/USD bears around 0.6545. To sum up, AUD/USD is likely to grind higher despite the latest retreat. AUD/USD: Daily chart  Trend: Recovery expected Additional important levels  ",0
"EUR/USD is continuously juggling in a narrow range above the round-level support of 1.0700 in the Asian session. It seems that investors have been sidelined ahead of the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Therefore, the major currency pair is mimicking the pre-Fed policy period and is likely to continue its sideways performance. S&P500 futures are adding further gains, carry forwarding the recovery performance on Monday as investors cheered liquidity assistance from various financial institutions to First Republic Bank after solvency issues. It seems that investors are showing maturity in efforts made for easing financial instability, portraying a recovery in the risk appetite theme. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is also demonstrating a lackluster performance around 103.30 as the street looks confused about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. The commentary has come from Futuristic carmaker Elon Musk that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by at least 50 basis points (bps). The rationale behind the commentary could be an expected recession due to sheer policy tightening. Meanwhile, demand for US governmentbondsstill looks weak as the return offered looks solid at higher levels. The 10-year US Treasury yields have been recorded at 3.5%, at the time of writing. Yields have been supported after the promise of a liquidity influx of $30 billion by various financial institutions to support the First Republic Bank. Investors look ambiguous over Fed policy Inflation in theUnited Statesis still stubborn despite the case of the declining trend for the past few months. Therefore, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to continue its policy-tightening cycle to bring down inflationary pressures to the desired levels. However, fresh evidence of banking sector shakedown has alarmed that the United States economy could face a deep recession. Higher inflationary pressures would join hands with the banking sector fiasco, which would impact the scales of economic activities dramatically. Apart from the interest rate policy, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell would also deliver the dot plot plan, a roadmap dictating further rate hikes to achieve price stability. The Federal Reserve is still sticking to its prior terminal rate projection of around 5.25%, therefore, no surprises are expected for the interest rate guidance. ECB Lagarde escalates fears of higher inflation projections The Euro remained extremely active on Monday amid the commentary from European Central Bank (ECB) PresidentChristine Lagarde. European Central BankLagardeconfirmed that Eurozone inflation would remain higher for a longer period and shifted the blame to rising wage pressures. She reiterated that wage pressures have strengthened on the back of robust labor markets and added that employees are aiming to recoup some of the purchasing power. Upward guidance on Eurozone inflation has strengthened the case for the continuation of bigger rates from the European Central Bank. Investors should be aware that the European Central Bank hiked its interest rates by 50 bps to 3.5% last week despite the demise of Credit Suisse. Apart from that, investors were curious about the exposure of Eurozone banks to the Credit Suisse debacle. On which, European Central Bank Lagarde claimed thatEurozonebanks' exposure to Credit Suisse was in Euro millions, not billions, per Reuters. EUR/USD technical outlook  EUR/USD has displayed sheer strength after a Triple Bottom formation on an hourly scale. A Triple Bottom is a bullish reversal chart pattern that indicates an absence of selling pressure in the major currency pair while testing previous lows. The shared currency pair is marching towards the potential resistance plotted from March 15 high at 1.0740. Upward-sloping 20-and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 1.0710 and 1.0687 respectively add to the upside filters.

"USD/JPY hovers around the 131.00 mark during Tuesday's Asian session, maintaining its bearish bias. Although US Treasury (UST) bond yields were boosted on Monday, USD/JPY failed to capitalize significantly. This can be attributed to the struggling global banking sector, as many commercial banks faltered last week. Consequently, investors rushed to purchase USTbonds, causing yields to decline. USD/JPYclosely follows the UST yield direction, so, unsurprisingly, the US Dollar remains under pressure. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve restarted swap lines to provide US Dollar liquidity to central banks in need, in addition to the Fed's discount window. This rapid action has flooded the market with excess US Dollar liquidity, resulting in widespread weakness. As the market heads toward Wednesday's FOMC meeting, caution is advised. The global banking system is already strained, and a further increase in borrowing costs could exacerbate existing issues. The market anticipates a 25 basis point (bps) rate hike from the Fed. Trading during the FOMC event requires extra caution, as this meeting differs from a typical one with pre-set expectations. With investors divided over various variables,volatilityis expected. It is always recommended to be especially careful, as the market could reverse during the press conference. It is crucial to pay attention toFedChair Jerome Powell's press conference, as the media will scrutinize his statements for any unexpected comments that could trigger market volatility.

The USD Index has printed an intraday high of 103.43 as pre-Federal Reserve (Fed) anxiety is expected to play ahead. However, the upside bias for Cable is still favored as odds for a steady monetary policy by the Fed are gaining the limelight. S&P500 futures are holding nominal gains added in the Asian session as investors are expecting thatFedchair Jerome Powell would keep the focus on the deepening stress in the United States after the collapse of three mid-size commercial banks in just one week and sidelined the topic of stubborn inflation. Returns offered on US governmentbondsare withholding gains as the liquidity influx by financial institutions to support the First Republic Bank could propel inflationary pressures. The 10-year US Treasury yields have scaled to near 3.5%.

Wednesday’s ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) will be followed by Thursday’s BoE interest rate decision. As per the estimates, the annual headline CPI is expected to trim to 9.8% from the former release of 10.1%. While the core CPI that excludes oil and food prices would remain steady at 5.8%. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey might continue hiking rates despite a decline in the inflationary pressures and potential banking crisis as the scale of CPI is extremely high.

"The EUR/CHF pair is attempting to come out of the woods for an upside move above the immediate resistance of 0.9966 in the Asian session. The cross has remained in action after the demise of Credit Suisse, the second-largest bank in Switzerland. Although UBS has announced the acquisition of the former, the street expects that the fears of further banking turmoil would stay for a while. The Euro has gained traction as European Central Bank (ECB) PresidentChristine Lagardehas revised its guidance forEurozoneinflation on the upside. ECBLagardecited that inflation is projected to remain too high for too long, as reported by Reuters. She further added that wage pressures have strengthened on the back of robust labor markets and added that employees are aiming to recoup some of the purchasing power. This has bolstered hopes of the continuation of bigger rate hikes from the ECB. EUR/CHF pair has extended its upside journey to near the prior inventory adjustment area whose breakdown led to a massive sell-off. The inventory adjustment area in a range of 0.9923-0.9967 serves as a territory where the asset spent the majority of time in its prior move and also covers significant volume. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.9940 is sloping north and will continue to provide support to the Euro bulls. Adding to that, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates that bullish momentum is already active. For further upside, a decisive break above March 20 high at 0.9966 will drive the cross toward the psychological resistance at 1.0000 followed by March 02 high at 1.0042. On the flip side, a downside break below March 16 low at 0.9800 would drag the cross toward    March 14 low at 0.9748. A slippage below the latter would expose the cross to March 15 low at 0.9706.

The Aussie asset still looks vulnerable below 0.6700 and is expected to continue its downside as the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes have confirmed that RBA policymakers are not very hawkish as expected by the street. In considering the policy decision, members observed that inflation in Australia remained too high, the labor market was very tight and wage growth had picked up. Surveys continued to signal that business conditions were favorable. Also, RBA policymakers considered the option of 25 basis points (bps) only despite persistent inflation in the Australian economy. For inflation guidance, the minutes show that RBA policymakers are worried that the monthly ConsumerPrice Index(CPI) could remain volatile from month to month despite softening from its peak of 8.4%, recorded in December.

"USD/JPY renews its intraday high near 131.70 during the first positive day in three amid early Tuesday in Europe. In doing so, the Yen pair bounces off the lowest levels in five weeks while poking a one-week-old resistance line. That said, the sluggish MACD signals and the RSI (14) line’s battle with the fortnight-old trend line resistance suggests that the upside momentum is likely to return to the table. Adding strength to the bullish bias could be the USD/JPY pair’s recovery from an ascending support line from January 16, close to 130.60 by the press time. As a result, theUSD/JPY pairis likely to cross the immediate trend line hurdle surrounding 131.70, which in turn could allow the buyers to aim for another upside hurdle, namely a downward-sloping resistance line from March 08, close to 133.10 at the latest. It should, however, be noted that the USD/JPY bulls should remain cautious unless the quote remains below the 200-SMA level surrounding 134.10. Alternatively, a clear downside break of the stated multi-day-old support line, around 130.60, isn’t an open invitation to the USD/JPY bears as multiple lows marked during February 10 and early January, respectively near 129.80 and 128.00, as well as the Year-To-Date (YTD) bottom near 127.20 could challenge the Yen pair sellers afterward.

"The GBP/USD paircomes under some selling pressure on Tuesday and snaps a three-day winning streak to its highest level since early February, around the 1.2285 region touched the previous day. The pair maintains its offered tone through the first half of the European session and is currently placed near the lower end of its daily range, around the 1.2235-1.2230 zone. A strong follow-through recovery in the US Treasury bond yields assists the US Dollar (USD) to regain some positive traction and reverse a part of the overnight losses to a five-week low, which, in turn, exerts downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. The US bond yields breathed a sigh of relief on Monday after the news that UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a $3.24 billion deal helped ease fears of widespread contagion risk. That said, rising bets for a less aggressive policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) could act as a headwind for the US bond yields and cap any meaningful upside for the Greenback. In fact, the markets now seem convinced that theFedwill soften its hawkish stance and deliver a smaller 25 bps rate hike at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Market participants also expect that the US central bank might even cutratesduring the second half of the year. The speculations were fueled by the collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Hence, investors will closely scrutinize the accompanying monetary policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments during the post-meeting presser for fresh clues about the future rate-hike path. This will be followed by the Bank of England (BoE) policy meeting, which will play a key role in influencing the British Pound and provide a fresh directional impetus to the GBP/USD pair.

A generally positive risk tone undermines demand for the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. The news that UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a $3.24 billion deal helps ease fears of widespread contagion risk and boosts investors' confidence. This is evident from a further recovery in the equity markets, which, along with a modest US Dollar bounce from a five-week low touched on Monday, remains supportive of the intraday move up. The USD draws some support from a further recovery in the US Treasury bond yields, though expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will adopt a less hawkish stance keeps a lid on any meaningful upside. In fact, the current market pricing indicates a greater chance of a 25 bps Fed rate hike on Wednesday. Investors also expect that the US central bank might even cutratesduring the second half of the year and the speculations were fueled by the recent collapse of two mid-size US banks.

Apart from this, a generally positive risk tone, supported by the news that UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a $3.24 billion deal, keeps a lid on the safe-haven Greenback and might help limit deeper losses for the risk-sensitive Aussie, at least for the time being.

TheFedwill announce its decision on Wednesday and is widely expected to deliver a smaller 25 bps rate hike. Market participants also expect that the US central bank might even cutratesduring the second half of the year. Hence, investors will look for fresh clues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will influence the near-term USD price dynamics and determine the near-term trajectory for the AUD/USD pair. Heading into the key central bank event risk, traders on Tuesday might take cues from the release of the US Existing Home Sales data, due later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields, will drive the USD demand and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair. Apart from this, the broader risk sentiment could further contribute to producing short-term opportunities. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0
"GBP/USD edges modestly lower but the undertone remains positive, economists at Scotiabank report. Price action looks consolidative ahead of another push higher “Cable has drifted a little from yesterday’s late session high of 1.2285 but losses have been relatively limited and price action looks consolidative ahead of another push higher.” Spot gains through the 55-Day Moving Average (1.2139) and developing bullish trend momentum on the intraday and daily studies suggest scope for more GBP gains towards the 1.25 area in the short run on a break above 1.23.” “Support on dips to the mid/upper 1.21 area should be firm.” ",1
"EUR/USDhas so far defended the 100-Day Moving Average and low of January near 1.0520/1.0480 resulting in an initial bounce. Economists at Société Générale note that reclaiming 1.0800 would negate Head and Shoulders pattern. Break below 1.0520/1.0480 to trigger an extended down move “It is worth noting that the pair is evolving within a possible Head and Shoulders; the pattern towards downside should a breakdown below neckline materialize. Recent pivot high near 1.0800 is a short-term resistance, this must be reclaimed to negate the formation.” “If the pair breaks the neckline at 1.0520/1.0480, an extended down move is not ruled out. Next objectives would be at 1.0330 and September 2022 peak of 1.0220/1.0200.” ",1
"GBP/USD is now probing recent pivot high at 1.2270/1.2300. A move beyond here would open up the December peak near 1.2450 and perhaps projections of 1.2610, analysts at Société Générale report. Defending last week low of 1.2010 crucial for continuation in up move “Daily MACD has entered positive territory denoting regain of upward momentum.” “If the pair crosses above 1.2270/1.2300, the bounce could persist towards December peak near 1.2450 and perhaps even towards projections of 1.2610.” “Defending last week low of 1.2010 would be crucial for continuation in up move.”",1
"EUR/CHF has rebounded after retesting last November's low of 0.9710/0.9670. The pair must surpass the 1.0010/40 resistance zone to enjoy further gains, analysts at Société Générale report. Break of 0.9710/0.9670 to result in an extended decline “Daily MACD posted negative divergence and has dipped below equilibrium line denoting lack of steady upward momentum.” “The pair is now challenging the 50-DMA; multi month trend line at 1.0010/1.0040 remains a crucial resistance zone. Failure to cross this would mean persistence in consolidation.” “Break of recent trough near 0.9710/0.9670 is likely to result in an extended decline.” ",0

"The GBP/USD pair stalls a three-day-old uptrend on Tuesday and retreats from its highest level since early February touched the previous day. The pair maintains its offered tone through the early North American session and is currently placed just below the mid-1.2200s, though lacks follow-through. The pullback could be attributed to some repositioning trade ahead of this week's key central bank event risks - the crucial FOMC policy decision on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of England (BoE) meeting on Thursday. In the meantime, the prospects for a less hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed), along with a strong follow-through rally in the equity markets, drag the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) to a fresh five-week low and lends support to the GBP/USD pair. From a technical perspective, the overnight breakout through the 1.2200 mark, or the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of the January-March downfall was seen as a fresh trigger for bulls. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart are holding in positive territory and are still far from being in the overbought zone. This suggests that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the upside and supports prospects for the emergence of some dip-buying at lower levels. That said, it will still be prudent to wait for some follow-through buying beyond the monthly top, around the 1.2285 region set on Monday, before positioning for any further gains. The GBP/USD pair might then climb to test the next relevant hurdle near the 1.2320 region before eventually aiming to reclaim the 1.2400 round-figure mark. The momentum could get extended further towards the double-top resistance near the 1.2450 region, or the YTD peak touched in January. On the flip side, 61.8% Fibo. level, around the 1.2200 mark, now seems to protect the immediate downside. Sustained weakness below might prompt some technical selling and dragthe GBP/USD pairtowards the 1.2125 confluence support. The latter comprises 50% Fibo. level and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (SMA), which if broken decisively might shift the near-term bias back in favour of bearish traders and pave the way for deeper losses.

"The USD/JPY pair once again shows some resilience below the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of the January-March rally and attracts fresh buying near the 131.00 round-figure mark on Tuesday. Spot prices recover further from the lowest level since February 10, around the 130.55-130.50 area touched on Monday, and climb back closer to mid-132.00s during the early North American session. The risk-on impulse - as depicted by a further strong rally in the equity markets - undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and acts as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair. Bulls further take cues from the widening of the US-Japan rate differential, led by a solid recovery in the US Treasury bond yields over the past two sessions. That said, the prevalent US Dollar selling might cap any meaningful gains for the major. The aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop warrants caution before confirming that the USD/JPY pair's recent rejection slide from a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) has run its course. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive bets and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the highly-anticipated two-day FOMC monetary policy meeting, starting this Tuesday. From a technical perspective, the intraday positive move stalls near 50% Fibo. level. This is closely followed by the overnight swing high, around the 132.65 region, which should now act as a pivotal point. Some follow-through buying could trigger a short-covering rally and push the USD/JPY pair further beyond the 133.00 round figure, towards testing the 38.2% Fibo. level, around the 133.80-133.85 region. Heading into the key central bank event risk, the latter should keep a lid on any further upside for the USD/JPY pair. That said, a sustained move beyond the said barrier will negate any near-term negative outlook and shift the near-term bias in favour of bullish traders. This, in turn, will set the stage for a further appreciating move towards the 135.00 psychological mark, which coincides with the 100-day SMA. On the flip side, 61.8% Fibo. level, around the 131.35 region, now seems to protect the immediate downside ahead of the 131.00 mark and the overnight swing low, around the mid-130.00s. Failure to defend the said support levels will make theUSD/JPY pairvulnerable to challenging the 130.00 psychological mark. Spot prices could eventually drop to the 129.55-129.50 intermediate support en route to the 129.00 round figure. USD/JPY daily chart  Key levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1

"The EURUSD experienced a strong rally today, as an early Asian session dip found support at the upper edge of a crucial swing area between 1.0690 and 1.0704 (refer to the blue numbered circles in the chart above). The subsequent sharp upward movement propelled the price beyond another swing area, ranging from 1.0744 to 1.0752, and surpassed last week's failed break high at 1.07592. Today's peak reached 1.07879, just shy of the next upside target zone between 1.0799 and 1.0805. Following the day's high, a corrective move brought the price back down towards last week's high at 1.07592, where support buyers stepped in. Maintaining the 1.07592 level firmly establishes the buyers' control. Only a drop below this level and the swing area extending to 1.0744 would bolster sellers' confidence, likely resulting in further downside probing. In the absence of such a move, the buyers maintain the upper hand. If the price surpasses today's high of 1.07879, traders will aim for the previously mentioned swing area between 1.0799 and 1.0805. Keep an eye on these critical levels to gauge the direction of the EURUSD going forward. The move to the upside today's been supported by higher yields in Europe.

Meanwhile, traders focus shifted to the FOMC’s monetary policy decision. TheFedhas the challenge of providing stable prices and financial stability. Given that inflation stays at three times the Fed’s target, the Fed could take a page of the Bank of England’s (BoE) blueprint for handling financial stability.

Also challenging the quote could be the market’s cautious mood ahead of the key data/events as the Federal Reserve (Fed) decision data begins. The Cablepair’s latest losses could be linked to the improvement in the market’s sentiment and a rebound in the US Treasury bond yields that allowed the US Dollar to pro recent south-run at the five-week low. Behind the moves could be the comments from the US policymakers, as well as actions, to tame the fears emanating from the latest banking fallouts.

"USD/JPYfinds some respite on rising US Treasury (UST) bond yields. U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, informed bankers on Tuesday that she is ready to protect depositors in smaller U.S. banks amid contagion concerns. The strong commitment from US officials has ignited a positiverisk appetite, leading Wall Street to close Tuesday on a positive note. UST yields experienced a strong bounce as investors moved away from bonds and into riskier assets. Tuesday's upbeat sentiment received additional support from a meeting between Chinese President Xi and Russian President Putin.

Despite the ongoing banking turmoil, the market is finding consensus for a 25 bps rate hike, following the argument thatliquidityinjections and rate hikes can occur simultaneously. The US Treasury will likely take measures to support deposit guarantees, despite opposition from some senators. However, such a support plan must first pass through the parliamentary process. Given that the summary of projections for the upcomingFedmeeting was conducted before the banking turmoil, the focus will shift to the accompanying statement and dot plots. The most crucial aspect will likely be the opening remark during Fed Chair Powell's press conference and his assessment of the ongoing banking crisis. Any indication of a pause in rate hikes is expected to be positive for risk assets. Levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1

Reuters also mentioned that Matsuno made the comment at a government meeting to decide on the package of measures, which includes fresh cash payouts to low-income households and subsidies to curb households' electricity bills. The news confirms the previous day’s headlines from Japanese media Yomiuri that signaled the government’s efforts to defend the citizens from rising prices. The news also stated that the subsidies on Liquefied Petroleum (LP) gas is recommended for low-income households. “The pillar is to add a total of 1.2 trillion yen to the “regional revitalization temporary subsidy” that promotes measures at the discretion of local governments, so that they can respond more flexibly to the actual situation of the region,” said Yomiuri before the latest decision.

"EUR/CHF holds lower ground near 0.9930 during a sluggish Asian session on early Wednesday, following a pullback from the two-week high the previous day. The exotic pair rose to the highest levels in more than two weeks the previous day before reversing from 0.9978 as it failed to extend the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The reason could be linked to the unimpressive RSI and MACD signals. With the failure to stay beyond the 200-EMA and lackluster oscillators, namely the RSI (14) and MACD, EUR/CHF is likely to decline further, which in turn highlights the 100-EMA support of 0.9900 as the immediate attraction for the pair sellers. Following that, the 38.2% and 50%Fibonacciretracement level of the pair’s up-move from September 2022 to January 2023, respectively near 0.9835 and 0.9755, will be in focus. It’s worth noting, however, that a broad support zone comprising multiple lows marked since the mid-November 2022, between 0.9705 and 0.9720, appears a tough nut to crack for the EUR/CHF bears to break. On the flip side, a successful break of the 200-EMA becomes necessary for the EUR/CHF bulls to keep the reins. Even so, the 1.0000 psychological magnet and a downward-sloping resistance line from late January, close to 1.0022 by the press time, becomes crucial to challenge the upside moves.

"GBP/USD's bull run stalls at a long-ended descending trendline originating from the 1.3768 mark on a daily timeframe. This bullish surge is driven by broad-based US Dollar weakness amid falling US Treasury yields. Additionally, increasing expectations for the Bank of England (BoE) to pauseratesat their upcoming meeting also support the bullish momentum for Cable. With the bullish bias intact, a convincing break above the trendline could propel the pair toward the twice-tested 2023 high. Downside declines will likely be limited by the 50-Day Moving Average (DMA), situated below the previous day's low at around 1.2146.

The last line of support is observed at 1.1800, beyond which there is a vast uncharted territory. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals a higher high, supporting further bullish momentum.

"AUD/USD rebounded from Tuesday's low at 0.6650 as sentiment shifted andrisk appetiteincreased. The pair remains in consolidation as traders await the Federal Reserve (Fed) policy decision. Amid the ongoing banking turmoil, US authorities have introducedliquidityinjection plans sequentially. TheFedhas implemented the discount window and swap line to mitigate ongoing challenges, followed by strong support from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Efforts by US Treasury Secretary Yellen to calm nerves seemed to be effective as bank shares rallied on Tuesday. US government officials are also considering increasing the limit on deposit insurance for all small banks, despite opposition from some US senators. Tuesday's price action could signal a change in investors' mood and increase their appetite for another 25 basis point (bps) rate hike from the Fed. Diminishing concerns about banking turmoil suggest that central banks can refocus on taming inflation, resulting in an increased probability of a 25 bps rate hike from the Fed. As the FOMC meeting approaches, this meeting will be crucial. Two opposing forces are at play: one advocating for continued rate hikes until inflation is under control and the other urging a pause amid worsening banking conditions. Observing the Fed's priority during this challenging situation will be important. Traders should exercise extra caution heading into the FOMC meeting. Investors may interpret the Fed policy statement differently, and initial reactions could be reversed during Fed Chair Powell's press conference. Since the summary of economic projections was conducted before the banking turmoil, attention will be focused on the dot plots, forward guidance, and press conference. AUD/USD will likely reflect the risk sentiment during the Fed policy decision. Levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0
"EUR/USD treads water around 1.0770-80 as pre-Fed anxiety intensifies during early Wednesday. Adding strength to the cautious mood could be a speech fromEuropean Central Bank(ECB) President Christine Lagarde, as well as an ascending triangle formation established since March 01. Also read:EUR/USD aptly portrays pre-Fed anxiety below 1.0800, ECB’s Lagarde eyed It should be noted, however, that the Euro pair’s successful rebound from the 100-DMA joins the bullish MACD signals and upbeat RSI (14) line, not overbought, to keep the buyers hopeful. That said, the area between 1.0800 and 1.0700 currently restricts the EUR/USD pair’s moves. Adding strength to the 1.0800 hurdle is the late January low and February 14 swing high. Hence, the EUR/USD pair buyers have a tough run to the north. On the contrary, a downside break of the 1.0700 support can quickly drag the quote toward the 100-DMA support level surrounding 1.0595. Though, the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of theEUR/USDpair’s run-up between late last November and early February, around 1.0530, can test the bears afterward. Meanwhile, a successful break of the 1.0800 resistance confluence won’t hesitate to aim for January’s high of near 1.0930 before targeting the Year-To-Date (YTD) high marked in February around 1.1035.

"USD/JPYhovers around the 132.50 level amid softer US Treasury (UST) bond yields and calmer US futures. On Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen addressed a group of bankers, suggesting that the federal deposit guarantee could be extended to all small banks in the US. These suggestions come after the Federal Reserve (Fed) made synchronized efforts to injectliquidityinto the US market through swap lines and discount windows. Such actions have been reflected in the Fed's balance sheet as a spike occurred amid ongoing quantitative tightening. These actions have eased some banking concerns, resulting in a risk-on environment on Tuesday. Developments on the banking front have led investors to expand theirrisk appetiteto digest another 25 basis point (bps) rate hike from theFedon Wednesday. Markets are pricing in an 85% chance of a 25-basis-point rate hike when the Fed announces its monetary policy decision. The peak for the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate was seen at 5.5% only a few weeks ago, compared to around 4.8% now. Rapid action in the banking sector has refocused the Fed on the inflationary path, as it remains well above the 2% target. The main battle is likely to be with inflation. The Fed has clearly shown that if required, they can fight on both fronts while keeping the hiking cycle intact and easing if necessary. Any deviation from the expected 25 bps rate hike by the Fed could spark extremevolatility, which is very unlikely. Since the summary of economic projections was conducted prior to the banking turmoil, attention will shift to the dot plot, policy statements, and press conferences. Earlier comments from Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno indicated, “Will allocate more than 2 trillion Japanese Yen from reserves for measures to cushion the blow to the economy from rising prices.” Levels to watch USD/JPY  ",0
" AUD/USD renews its intraday high near 0.6700, paring the first daily loss in four marked the previous day, as traders brace for the all-important Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting during early Wednesday. Helping the Aussie buyers recently is the market’s cautious optimism surrounding the banking sector, as well as downbeat US Treasury bond yields. On the same line could be hopes for a strong economic transition in China. However, downbeat Aussie data joins hawkish bets on the US Federal Reserve (Fed), versus receding hopes of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) strong rate hike in near future, prod the AUD/USD pair buyers. While tracing the market’s optimism, headlines suggesting the US policymakers’ discussion on ways to surpass Congress to defend the banks, as well as chatters that the First Republic Bank eyes the government’s help gain major attention. On the same line are Tuesday’s comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who said, ""Treasury, Fed, FDIC actions reduced risk of further bank failures that would have imposed losses on deposit insurance fund.""  Previously, Bloomberg shared the news stating that “US officials are studying ways they might temporarily expand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage to all deposits, a move sought by a coalition of banks arguing that it’s needed to head off a potential financial crisis,” which in turn favored themarket sentimentand the AUD/USD price. It’s worth noting that China’s Securities Daily mentioned that theliquidityconditions in the nation remain ample, which in turn favors the AUD/USD buyers due to Aussie-China ties. Alternatively, Australia’s Westpac Leading Economic Index for February dropped for the seventh consecutive month to -0.06% at the latest and challenges the AUD/USD buyers. On the same line could be the market forecasts suggesting more than 85% chances of the Fed’s 0.25% rate hike in today’s meeting, versus the latest chatters that the RBA lacks ammunition to propelratesfurther. While portraying the mood, S&P 500 Futures remain lackluster around 4,040 despite upbeat Wall Street closing while benchmark US Treasury bond yields struggle to extend a two-day rebound from the lowest levels since September 2022. That said, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields mark a one basis point of downside near 3.60% and 4.18% respectively by the press time. Looking forward, AUD/USD is likely to grind higher amid downbeat US Treasury bond yields and optimism surrounding economic recovery in Australia’s biggest customer, namely China. However, major attention will be given to developments in the Fed’s dot plot and comments to push back banking turmoil in Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech as banking turmoil challenges the US central bank’s hawkish bias, despite the 0.25% rate hike expected.

"According to the latest data published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday, Britain’s annualized Consumer Prices Index (CPI) jumped to 10.4% in February against the 10.1% increase recorded in January while missing estimates of a 9.8% clip. Meanwhile, the Core CPI gauge (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased to 6.2% YoY last month versus 5.8% seen in January. The market expectations are for a 5.8% figure. The monthly figures showed that the UK consumer prices rose to 1.1% in February vs. 0.6% expectations and -0.6% last. The UK Retail Price Index for February stood at 1.2% MoM and 13.8% YoY, beating expectations across the time horizon. Additional takeaways (via ONS) “The largest upward contributions to the annual CPIH inflation rate in February 2023 came from housing and household services (principally from electricity, gas, and other fuels), and food and non-alcoholic beverages.” “The largest upward contributions to the monthly change in both the CPIH and CPI rates came from restaurants and cafes, food, and clothing, partially offset by downward contributions from recreational and cultural goods and services (particularly recording media), and motor fuels.” FX implications In an initial reaction to the UKCPInumbers, the GBP/USD pair jumped to session highs of 1.2264 before retreating to 1.2245, where it now wavers.

The Bank of England (BOE) is tasked with keeping inflation, as measured by the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) at around 2%, giving the monthly release its importance. An increase in inflation implies a quicker and sooner increase in interestratesor the reduction of bond-buying by theBOE, which means squeezing the supply of pounds. Conversely, a drop in the pace of price rises indicates loosermonetary policy. A higher-than-expected result tends to be GBP bullish.",0
"Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group suggestEUR/USDcould extend gains once 1.0800 is cleared. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we highlighted that ‘there is room for EUR to rise to 1.0760 before a pullback is likely’. We added, ‘The major resistance at 1.0800 is unlikely to come into view’. The anticipated advance was stronger than expected as EUR soared to a high of 1.0788. While overbought, the rapid rise is not showing signs of weakness just yet. Today, EUR could rise above 1.0800 but it remains to be seen if it can maintain a foothold above this major resistance level (the next resistance is at 1.0850). Support is at 1.0745, a breach of 1.0720 would indicate that EUR is not advancing further.” Next 1-3 weeks: “On Monday (20 Mar, spot at 1.0680), we indicated that EUR appears to be trading in a consolidation phase, likely in a broad range between 1.0600 and 1.0800. Yesterday (21 Mar, spot at 1.0720), we highlighted that ‘the firm short-term outlook suggest EUR is likely to test 1.0800 in the next few days’.  Upward momentum is beginning to improve but EUR has to break and stay above 1.0800 before a sustained rise is likely. The likelihood of EUR breaking clearly will remain intact as long as it stays above 1.0680 in the next couple of days. Looking ahead, the next resistance level above 1.0800 is at 1.0850.”",1
"The GBP/USD pairregains positive traction following the previous day's pullback from its highest level since February 02 and builds on its intraday gains through the early European session on Wednesday. The buying interest picks up pace following the release of the UK consumer inflation figures and pushes spot prices to a fresh daily high, beyond mid-1.2200s in the last hour. The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the headline CPI rose more than anticipated, by 1.1% in February as compared to the 0.6% decline recorded in the previous month. Adding to this, the yearly rate unexpectedly climbed to 10.4% during the reported month from 10.1% in January, again beating consensus estimates. The data increases pressure on the Bank of England (BoE) to hike by 25 bps at the very least on Thursday and provides a modest lift to the British Pound. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, languishes near a multi-week low amid the prospects for a less aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed). In fact, the markets seem convinced that the US central bank will soften its hawkish stance and deliver a smaller 25 bps at the end of the two-day FOMC policy meeting later this Wednesday. Apart from this, a modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields, along with easing fears of a full-blown banking crisis, undermine the safe-haven buck. The upside for the GBP/USD pair, however, seems limited as traders might prefer to move to the sidelines heading into the key central bank event risks - the highly-anticipatedFeddecision on Wednesday, followed by the BoE meeting on Thursday. Hence, any subsequent move-up runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly. That said, a sustained move beyond the weekly swing high, around the 1.2285 region, will be seen as a fresh trigger for bulls and pave the way for a further appreciating move.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Our view that AUD would strengthen yesterday was incorrect as it slumped to a low of 0.6650 in NY trade. Despite the decline, downward momentum has not improved much. While AUD could edge lower today, any decline is likely part of a lower range of 0.6640/0.6700. In other words, a clear break of 0.6640 is unlikely.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Two days ago (20 Mar, spot at 0.6700), we noted that improved upward momentum would likely lead to AUD trading with an upward bias towards 0.6780. However, AUD has not been able to make any headway on the upside. The rapid loss of momentum has diminished the odds for AUD to strengthen. However, only a breach of 0.6640 (no change in ‘strong support’ level) would indicate that AUD is likely to trade in a broad consolidation range instead of heading higher.”",0

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We did not anticipate the strong rebound in USD to a high of 132.62 yesterday (we were expecting USD to test the major support at 130.45). While there is room for USD to rebound further, any advance is unlikely to break 133.50.

However, USD rebounded sharply and took out our ‘strong resistance’ level at 132.60 (high of 132.62).

"TheUSD/JPY pairstruggles to capitalize on the previous day's rally of over 150 pips and oscillates in a narrow band below the weekly high touched earlier this Wednesday. The pair trades around the 132.55-132.60  area during the early European session, nearly unchanged for the day, as traders keenly await the outcome of the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy meeting. The Fed is scheduled to announce its decision later during the US session and is widely expected to deliver a smaller 25 bps rate hike. Moreover, the recent collapse of two mid-size US banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank - fueled speculations that the US central bank might even cut interestratesduring the second half of the year. Hence, the focus will be on the accompanying monetary policy statement, the updated economic projections and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at the post-meeting press conference. Investors will look for fresh cues about the future rate-hike path, which, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the near-term US Dollar price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to the USD/JPY pair. Heading into the key central bank event risk, the USD languishes near its lowest level since February 14 touched on Tuesday and acts as a headwind for the major. That said, a stable performance around the equity markets undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and lends some support to the pair. TheFedon Sunday unveiled an enhanced seven-day dollar swap to addliquidityinto the monetary system. Moreover, the news that UBS will rescue Credit Suisse in a $3.24 billion deal helps ease fears of a full-blown global banking crisis and boosts investors' confidence. This led to a strong rally across the global equity markets since the beginning of this week. This, along with a more dovish stance adopted by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) should continue to act as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being.

Investors’ attention, in the meantime, is seen shifting to the updated dots plot along with the press conference by Chief Powell, where a potential impasse in the Fed’s tightening stance should take centre stage.

"The GBP/USD pair catches fresh bids on Wednesday and the buying interest picks up pace during the first half of the European session in reaction to the strong UK consumer inflation figures. The momentum lifts spot prices to a fresh high since February 02, with bulls now awaiting a sustained strength beyond the 1.2300 mark before positioning for any further appreciating move. The hotter-than-expected UK CPI print adds pressure on the Bank of England (BoE) to hike interestratesby 25 bps at the very least on Thursday, which, in turn, boosts the British Pound. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, drops to a fresh multi-week low amid expectations for a less hawkishFedand further pushes the GBP/USD pair higher ahead of the key central bank event risks. From a technical perspective, the emergence of fresh buying on Wednesday validates this week's breakout through the 1.2200 mark, representing the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of the January-March downfall. Given that positive oscillators on the daily chart are still far from being in the overbought zone, some follow-through buying beyond the 1.2300 level will be seen as a fresh trigger for bulls. The GBP/USD pair might then climb to test the next relevant hurdle near the 1.2320 region before eventually climbing to the 1.2400 round-figure mark. The momentum could get extended further towards the double-top resistance near the 1.2450 region, or the YTD peak touched in January, above which bulls are likely to aim to reclaim the 1.2500 psychological mark for the first time since June 2022. On the flip side, the 1.2235 area now seems to protect the immediate downside ahead of the 1.2200 mark (61.8% Fibo.) and the overnight swing low, around the 1.2180-1.2175 region. A convincing break below might prompt some technical selling and drag the GBP/USD pair towards the 1.2125 confluence, comprising the 50% Fibo. level and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (SMA). The latter should act as a strong base forthe GBP/USD pair, which if broken decisively might shift the near-term bias back in favour of bearish traders and pave the way for deeper losses.

The pair sticks to its intraday gains through the first half of the European session and is currently placed near the top end of its daily range, around the 0.6700 mark. As investors look past the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hint of a rate pause, the prevalent selling bias around the US Dollar (USD) turns out to be a key factor that assists the AUD/USD pair to regain positive traction. It is worth recalling that the minutes of the RBA meeting held on March 7 revealed a step down in hawkishness as policymakers only considered a 25 bps hike and agreed to revisit the case for a pause at the April meeting amid the uncertaineconomic outlook. TheFed, meanwhile, is expected to soften its hawkish stance, which drags the USD to a fresh multi-week low and acts as a tailwind for the major.

Heading into the key central bank event risk, the aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop might hold back traders from placing aggressive directional bets.

This surge pushed the price towards Monday's high and a critical swing area ranging between 1.22608 and 1.22823 (indicated by red numbered circles on the four-hour chart). The price moved above that area, and peaked at 1.22967, just shy of the natural resistance at 1.2300. Subsequently, momentum could not be sustained, and sellers entered the market causing a retracement in gains. The price reached a low of 1.2220 in the last hour or so of trading, near the pre-UK CPI level of 1.22275. Currently, the price stands at 1.2236. Looking ahead, the swing area between 1.22608 and 1.22823 remains crucial. Buyers need to push through this range to assert more control. A move above this area, followed by a break above 1.2300, would boost buyers' confidence. Conversely, on a move to the downside the 61.8% retracement of the 2023 trading range would be targeted at 1.2200, coinciding with last week's swing highs (green numbered circles on the four-hour chart).

Fed Powell has cleared, ""Recentliquidityprovision for rescuing the collapse of commercial banks that has increased balance sheet size is not intended to alter the stance of monetary policy."" Meanwhile, S&P500 has surrendered its entire gains delivered on Tuesday after Fed Powell cleared that rate cuts are not in pipeline at least this year.

The banking crisis spurred three weeks ago changedFedofficials’ approach to the March meeting. Given that the US government had to step in after the collapse of two regional banks in theUnited States(US), it pushed Fed’s Powell 50 bps off the table. Fed policymakers stressed that inflation remains elevated, and the labor market is tight. Policymakers commented that the balance sheet reduction, known as Quantitative Tightening (QT), would continue as planned. The dot plot was almost unchanged, with most Fed officials expecting the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) to peak at around 5.10%. At the same time, the US Secretary of Treasure Janet Yellen said that “regulators aren’t looking to provide “blanket” deposit insurance to stabilize the US banking system,” according to Bloomberg. That rattled the US equity markets, which ended with an average of 1.60% losses on its three major indices, blamed on Yellen comments. All that said, US Treasury bond yields registered losses as investors reassessed a less hawkish Fed.

Fed matched market forecasts by announcing 25 basis points (bps) rate hike but statements like “some additional policy firming may be appropriate,” instead of “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate” gained major attention and drowned the USD. Fed ChairJerome Powell, however, tried to tame the rate cut hopes by saying that officials do not see rate cuts for this year, which in turn allowed breathing space to the greenback bears in the last. Apart from the Fed announcements, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments also allowedthe US Dollar Indexto rebound from a seven-week low, by way of challenging therisk appetite, as she ruled out considering “blanket insurance” for bank deposits. On the other hand, policymakers from theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) appear more hawkish and stand ready for heavy rate hikes if the banking crisis eases, which in turn propelled the EUR/USD more.

ECB’s Lagarde, however, also said that they are neither committed to raising further nor are we finished with hikingrates.

Service-sector firms' mood rebounded in a sign of domestic demand-driven recovery, in which the prospects of higher wages among big firms at the spring labor talks may encourage households to spend their way out of the COVID-induced doldrums. The mixed results underscored the fragility of the world's No.3 economy as exports slow and private consumption, which accounts for more than half the economy, lacks momentum.

On the recent banking fiasco, Fed Powell has loaded blame on the management of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) citing it as ‘failed badly’.

Adding strength to the Cable pair’s run-up towards the 10-month-old resistance line near 1.2350 is the Brexit optimism and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) dovish hike, as well as the downbeat US Treasury bond yields. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s victory in getting the Brexit bill passed through the House of Commons, despite major criticism from Tory rebels seems to underpin the GBP/USD upside. ""Rishi Sunak has escaped an overly damaging Commons rebellion over his revised plan for post-Brexit Northern Ireland trade, winning a vote on the measure with 22 of his own MPs voting against the deal,” said The Guardian. Also keepingthe Cablebuyers hopeful could be the hawkish hopes from the BoE, especially after the previous day’s strong UK inflation data.

On the other hand, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) confirmed the market’s expectations of announcing a 0.25% rate hike but failed to convince the policy hawks and drowned the US Dollar. The reason could be linked to the statements saying, “Some additional policy firming may be appropriate,” instead of previous remarks like “Ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.” It should be noted that Fed ChairJerome Powelland US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments triggered the market’s pessimism as Fed’s Powell said that officials do not see rate cuts for this year, which in turn allowed breathing space to the greenback bears but failed to last long. Further, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen ruled out considering “blanket insurance” for bank deposits. Recently, Bloomberg also came out with the news suggesting that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is said to delay the bid deadline for a Silicon Valley private bank.

Apart from the absence of insurance for all uninsured deposits, US Treasury yields have heavily plunged as Fed is considering a pause to the rate-hiking spree. Fed confirms tight credit conditions from US banks to maintain financial stability Federal Reserve Powell has said a big no to rate cuts in 2023 as the battle against stubborn inflation is on and will remain in effect till US inflation gets restored to desired levels. However, his commentary remained to favor extremely less room for a further rate hike. Therefore, the time has ripe now as the Federal Reserve will maintain these higher rates for a longer period. In spite of the absence of more rate hikes, US inflation will continue to remain under pressure as US banks will tighten their credit conditions for businesses and households to safeguard themselves from delinquency. In his commentary, Federal Reserve Powell cited that US banking is sound and resilient but lends would remain cautionary while disbursing advances. This would cool off heated demand, the scale of economic activities, and inflationary pressures. European Central Bank reiterates fears of higher inflation A recent rise in energy costs in Eurozone is accompanying higher wage pressures in keeping inflation at elevated levels. TheEuropean Central Bank(ECB) has already pushedratesto 3.5% but has failed in bringing inflation down meaningfully. On Wednesday, Reuters reported, “The recent increase in financial market risks has made it more difficult for central banks to fight inflation,” the five “wise ones” who advise Berlin on economic policy said in their biannual report. The commentary from wise ones got strengthened after European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde reiterated ""Inflation is still high and uncertainty around its path ahead has increased."" EUR/USD technical outlook  EUR/USD has shifted confidently above the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement (placed from February 01 high at 1.1033 to March 15 low at 1.0516) at 1.0834 on a two-hour scale. Upward-sloping 10-and 20-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 1.0854 and 1.0819 indicates that the upside momentum is extremely solid. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is hovering in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates more upside ahead. EUR/USD  ",1
" USD/JPYpicks up bids to pare intraday losses around 130.80 amid early Thursday morning in Europe. In doing so, the Yen pair bounces off a six-week low marked earlier in the day as traders seek more clues to extend the Federal Reserve (Fed) induces moves. Adding strength to the corrective bounces could be the key policymakers’ rejection of the financial crisis, as well as the downbeat details of Japan’s Reuters Tankan survey. “Big Japanese manufacturers remained pessimistic about business conditions for a third straight month in March,” the closely watched Reuters Tankan survey showed early Thursday. “The sentiment index for big manufacturers stood at minus 3, slightly up from minus 5 seen in the previous month, according to the survey conducted March 8-17,” reported Reuters. On the same line are Citibank CEO Jane Fraser’s efforts to placate market fears while saying, ""This is not a credit crisis. This is a situation where it's a few banks,"" per Bloomberg. It should be noted that multiple central bank officials have also tried their hands to rule out fears of the 2008 crisis earlier but have failed so far. However, their swift reaction to the fallouts of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and Credit Suisse gains applause and pushes back the odds of the market’s collapse. Even so, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields stay pressured around 3.46% and 3.89% at the latest, licking their wounds after falling the most in a week, which in turn exerts downside pressure on the USD/JPY prices. It should be noted that the yields dropped heavily after the Federal Reserve announcements on Wednesday, snapping a two-day rebound. Fed confirmed the market’s expectations of announcing a 0.25% rate hike but failed to convince the policy hawks and drowned the yields, as well as the US Dollar. The reason could be linked to the statements saying, “Some additional policy firming may be appropriate,” instead of previous remarks like “Ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.” It should be noted that Fed ChairJerome Powelland US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments triggered the market’s pessimism. Fed’s Powell said that officials do not see rate cuts for this year, which in turn allowed breathing space to the greenback bears but failed to last long. Further, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen ruled out considering “blanket insurance” for bank deposits. Recently, Bloomberg also came out with the news suggesting that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is said to delay the bid deadline for a Silicon Valley private bank. Against this backdrop, S&P 500 Futures print mild gains around 3,980, up 0.13% intraday following the biggest daily slump in two weeks. Looking ahead, monetary policy announcements from the Bank of England (BoE) and Swiss National Bank (SNB) may entertain USD/JPY traders by way of the central bankers’ reaction to the banking crisis. However, major attention will be given to Friday’s Japan National Consumer Price Index data for February amid hawkish bias surrounding the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Technical analysis An ascending support line from the mid-January, around 130.40 by the press time, restricts immediate USD/JPY downside. However, the Yen pair buyers remain off the table unless witnessing clear break of a fortnight-old resistance line, close to 131.85 at the latest. Additional important levels  ",0
"The GBP/USD pair has printed a fresh day high at 1.2330 in the early European session. The upside bias for Cable is backed by further weakness inthe US Dollar Index(DXY) as the Federal Reserve (Fed) is approaching the phase of policy-tightening. Also, rising hawkish bets for Bank of England (BoE) policy after a surprise jump in the United Kingdom inflation is supporting the Pound Sterling. Economists at Bank of America Global Research (BoA) are expecting a 25bp BoE rate hike, with dovish guidance. The USD Index is struggling to sustain above 102.00 and is expected to extend its downside journey as the spotlight has shifted to risk-perceived assets. S&P500 futures have recovered firmly, indicating some revival in therisk appetiteof the market participants. GBP/USD is auctioning in a Rising Channel chart pattern on a four-hour scale in which every pullback is considered as a buying opportunity by the market participants. The Cable is marching towards the horizontal resistance plotted from December 13 high at 1.2444. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2245 is providing cushion to the Pound Sterling bulls. A range shift move by the Relative Strength into the bullish arena of 40.00-80.00 from the bearish region of 20.00-60.00 indicates more upside ahead. The Cable has already shown a stellar rally, therefore, a mean-reversion move to near 10-period EMA 1.2275 would be an optimal opportunity for making fresh long. This will drive the asset toward December 05 high at 1.2345 followed by the horizontal resistance plotted from December 13 high at 1.2444. On the flip side, a breakdown below March 21 low at 1.2212 would dragthe Cabletoward the round-level support around 1.2100 and March 15 low around 1.2000. GBP/USD four-hour chart  GBP/USD  ",0
"The AUD/USD pair has scaled higher to 0.6750 in the early European session. The Aussie asset has been strengthened after the Federal Reserve (Fed) chairJerome Powelldelivered cues about pausing the rating-hiking spree after hikingratesby 25 basis points (bps) to 4.75%-5.00%. The street is expecting that Fed Powell has considered a pause amid fears of a banking debacle after the collapse of three mid-size United States banks. However, the Fed has not surrendered its weapons in front of stubborn inflation yet as one more rate is still in pipeline and the central bank won’t look for any rate cuts this year. S&P500 futures have stretched their recovery dramatically as investors are shifting their focus to rate-hiking pause signals from expectations of tight credit conditions by US banks for advances. Fed Powell in his commentary about the condition of the US banking sector claimed that US banks are strong and resilient, however, recent events of financial instability could not rule out more filter execution from banks while disbursement of advances. Tight credit conditions by US banks would lead to delays in advances to households and businesses, which could impact inflation, overall demand, and economic activities. Firms could witness a working capital crisis if advances get delayed and would get prone to an operating loss. The US Dollar Index(DXY) is an inch far from the 102.00 cushion in the early European session. More downside in the USD Index cannot be ruled as an absence of assurance of blanket insurance for all deposits by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has dented the confidence of investors in the US administration. On the Australian Dollar front, investors are awaiting the release of preliminary S&P Global PMI (March) data. As per the consensus,Manufacturing PMIwill contract to 50.3 and Service PMI will decline to 49.9. AUD/USD  ",1

"The Bank of England’s decision is coming up. Any hints of a pause could drag the Pound down, but at lower levels, GBP would quickly draw in fresh buying to limit the scale of decline, according to economists at MUFG Bank. Maybe a guidance shift to hint at a pause “We would certainly argue that a hike today is unnecessary and a close call could be reflected in further division within the MPC. We will be watching the wording on policy guidance. In February the MPC stated that ‘if there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required’. The conditionality of this guidance could be flipped to signalling a pause based on the condition that inflation pressures subside as the BoE expected. “A signal of a pause at this juncture would seerateslower and take GBP lower too although we suspect at lower levels GBP would quickly draw in fresh buying to limit the scale of decline.” “Any decline for GBP is likely a good buying opportunity.” See –BoE Preview: Forecasts from eight major banks, final 25 bps hike",1

Guidance will be key for the GBP’s short-term reaction.” “We think the BoE tightening cycle is likely completed after today’s move to 4.25% so it risks sounding dovish; markets are pricing in a bit more tightening, however.

Standard Chartered “We expect headline CPI inflation to have expanded to 3.3% YoY, down from 4.3% in January. Similarly, core CPI inflation excluding fresh food may also have increased to 3.2%, less than 4.2% prior. However, core CPI excluding food and energy likely grew by 3.4% YoY in February, higher than 3.2% prior. The moderation in headline and core CPI inflation is mainly due to the base effect of oil prices, in our view. Tokyo CPI inflation, which is a leading indicator of national CPI inflation, increased to 3.4%, down from 4.4% in January. Tokyo core CPI inflation also dropped to 3.3% from 4.4% prior. However, core Tokyo CPI inflation rose to 3.2% from 3.0% prior, indicating that CPI inflation is sticky and headline CPI may take time to fall below the Bank of Japan's 2% target level.” ING “Consumer inflation in Japan is expected to cool to 3.5% YoY in February (vs 4.3% in January) due to the government’s energy subsidy programme, helped along by the base effects of a slowdown.” SocGen “Weforecastnationwide core CPI of 3.2% YoY in February, significantly down from the 4.2% YoY seen in January.

"GBP/USD bulls take a breather around the highest levels in nearly two months, making rounds to 1.2290 after rising in the last two consecutive days, as the volatile week is left with one last ball to play.The Cablepair cheered the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) dovish rate hike, as well as the Bank of England’s (BoE) readiness for more rate increases to renew the multi-day top of late. However, the mixed US data and sentiment seem to allow the quote to pare recent gains ahead of the key statistics. On Thursday, the Bank of England (BoE) raised the policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 4.25%, as expected. The policy statement highlighted an increase in Q2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)forecastwhile also estimating a slower growth in Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the same. ""UK banking system is well-placed to support the economy, including in a period of higher interestrates,"" added the BoE statement.

"USD/JPY portrays a corrective bounce off the multi-day low amid mixed inflation numbers from Japan and a shift in the sentiment during early Friday, following a volatile week. That said, the Yen pair picks up bids to 130.80 as it prints the first daily gain in three while keeping the late Thursday’s bounce off the lowest levels since February 10. Japan’s National Consumer Price Index eased to 3.3% YoY in February from 4.3% prior and 4.1% market forecasts. However, the National CPI ex Food, Energy rose to 3.5% YoY compared to the analysts’ estimates of 3.4% and the 3.2% prior readings. Apart from the mixed Japan data, a shift in the market’s mood, amid increasing fears of banking rout andFedrate hikes seems to also allow the US Dollar to pare the weekly losses, which in turn allows the Yen pair to consolidate the latest losses. It should be noted that a collapse in the banking shares and chatters that the Fed’s emergency lending to the banks has ballooned the balance sheet, renewing fears of more Fed rate hikes, which in turn allowed the DXY to pare recent losses. Also favoringthe US Dollar Indexbuying could be the mixed US data. Reuters said, “Federal Reserve emergency lending to banks, which hit record levels the last week, remained high in the latest week, amid continued large-scale extensions of credit to the financial system, which now includes official foreign borrowing.” The news also mentioned that borrowing from the Fed caused the size of its overall balance sheet to move to $8.8 trillion from $8.7 trillion the prior week. Elsewhere, mixed US data and comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also allow USD/JPY to lick its wounds. That said, the US Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) dropped to -0.19 in February versus 0.0 expected and 0.23 prior.

The major currency pair is expected to continue its downside momentum toward the round-level support of 1.0800. The downside bias for shared currency pair is strengthening as the US Dollar Index (DXY) has shown a significant recovery. S&P500 futures remain silent after a recovery move on Thursday backed by the promise of insurance on additional deposits by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, which restored the confidence of investors, portraying some optimism in US equities.The US Dollar Index(DXY) has extended its recovery to near 102.70 as other western central banks are also following the footprints of the Federal Reserve (Fed). On Wednesday, at the monetary policy meeting, Fed chairJerome Powelldelivered signs of concluding the year-long rate hiking spree to avoid any further mess in the banking crisis. Also,rateshave reached to a point where room for further escalation is less. Like the Fed, other central banks are also eyeing a pause in the rate-hiking cycle such as the Bank of England (BoE), and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Therefore, the USD Index has shown a recovery move due to its safe-haven appeal. Meanwhile, the demand for US government bonds has extended further as investors have cheered that the Fed is pausing rate hikes sooner. Higher demand for US bonds has trimmed the return offered on 10-year US Treasury yields below 3.4%. Going forward, the release of the preliminary S&P Global Eurozone/US PMIs (March) will be keenly watched. Mixed performance is expected from both economies. On the Eurozone front, unlike other economies, bigger rate hikes are still preferred as theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) has still more room left. Also, the core inflation is extremely stubborn due to high wage pressures. ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said that the ECB is unlikely to be done with rate hikes and added that they still think that they need to raise the policy rate in May. EUR/USD  ",0
"The EUR/CHF pair has retreated after a short-lived recovery to near 0.9934 in the Asian session. The asset witnessed a steep fall on Thursday after the Swiss National Bank (SNB) hiked rates by 50 basis points (bps) to 1.50% despite fears of financial instability propelled by the demise of Credit Suisse. After hiking the interest rate,SNBChairman Thomas J. Jordan cited “We are raising rates to counter the renewed increase in inflationary pressure. The guidance on interest rates from SNB Jordan was also hawkish as the central bank is ready to raiseratesfurther to ensure price stability. On the Eurozone front, investors will keep an eye on preliminary S&P Global PMI (March) figures. As per the consensus, theManufacturing PMIis seen at 49.0, higher than the prior release of 48.5. While the Services PMI might decline to 52.5 from the former release of 52.7. EUR/CHF has breakdown the higher lows structure after challenging March 21 low at 0.9926 on an hourly scale. The downside bias for the cross was built after a negative bearish divergence, which showed exhaustion in the upside momentum. It is worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) formed a lower high while the asset was continuously forming higher highs. A bear cross, represented by the 20-and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 0.9954, indicates more weakness ahead. The RSI (14) has also slipped into the bearish range of 20.00-40.00, which indicates that the bearish momentum is active. More losses would be discovered if the cross slips below March 23 low at 0.9920, which will drag the asset toward March 15 high at 0.9883 followed by the round-level support at 0.9800. On the flip side, a decisive break above March 20 high at 0.9966 will drive the cross toward the psychological resistance at 1.0000 followed by March 02 high at 1.0042.

"USD/JPY licks its wounds near 130.60, after refreshing a 1.5-month low, during a three-day downtrend on early Friday. In doing so, the Yen pair sellers attack the support line stretched from early January while extending the mid-week pullback from the 50-DMA. In addition to the pair’s inability to cross the 50-DMA, around 132.60 by the press time, the bearish MACD signals also weigh on the quote and suggest the downside break of the immediate support line, close to 130.50 at the latest. Following that, the 130.00 round figure and multiple levels marked in February near 129.30, as well as near 128.00, could test the USD/JPY bears before directing them to the yearly low of 127.21. It’s worth noting, however, that the Yen pair’s sustained weakness past 127.21, could make it vulnerable to testing the 61.8%FibonacciExpansion (FE) of its moves between October 2022 and March 2023, near 122.50. Alternatively,USD/JPYrecovery can initially aim for the 50-DMA hurdle of 132.60. However, a horizontal area comprising multiple tops marked since February 17, close to 135.20, appears a tough nut to crack for the bulls afterward.

"AUD/USD prints the first daily loss in three around 0.6670 while bracing for the weekly loss during early Friday. In doing so, the Aussie pair justifies its risk barometer status, as well as downbeat activity data at home.

That said, the Manufacturing gauge slid to 48.7 versus 50.3 expected and 50.7 prior while Services PMI declined to 48.2 from 50.7 previous readings and 49.7 market forecasts. With this, the CompositePMIdropped to 48.1 compared to 50.6 prior.

While portraying the mood, the S&P 500 Futures struggle to copy Wall Street’s positive moves. Apart from the Fed bets, comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision also weigh on the market’s mood and favor the AUD/USD sellers. On Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, “China and Russia may want to develop an alternative to the US dollar,” while also showing preparedness for additional deposit actions `if warranted'. On the other hand, the Financial Times (FT) said that the head of the world’s top financial regulator, Pablo Hernández de Cos, has called for tighter rules to clamp down on risks spreading from so-called “shadow banks” to other parts of the banking system.

While the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) dovish hike joined downbeat yields to previously propel the Cable buyers, fresh fears surrounding banking sector fallouts and hopes of longer tighter monetary policy from the Fed seem to have teased the GBP/USD sellers of late. It should be noted, however, that the downbeat US Treasury bond yields and mixed US data keep the pair buyers hopeful as they wait for key statistics.

Adding strength to the pullback moves was the quote’s inability to cross an important horizontal resistance around 1.0930-35. It should be noted, however, that the mixed concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) next move and theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) official’s hawkish comments probed bears of late. That said, the fears of a ballooning Fed balance sheet renew hawkish calls for the US central banks and join the global banking turmoil to weigh on the sentiment and allow the US Dollar to lick its wounds near the seven-week low.

"GBP/USD has attempted a recovery after dropping to near 1.2260 in the early European session. The recovery move in Cable is backed by a loss of upside momentum inthe US Dollar Index(DXY). The Cable remained topsy-turvy after the interest rate decision by the Bank of England (BoE). The Pound Sterling was heavily volatile on Thursday after Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey delivered a promise of rapid inflation softening from the second quarter with 25 basis points (bps) interest rate hike and dovish interest rate guidance. The USD Index is demonstrating exhaustion after a decent rally to near 102.68. The mighty US Dollar is sensing the heat as investors are anticipating that the United States inflation has entered into an Armageddon, and qualitative and quantitative tools against Consumer Price Index (CPI) would be extremely sharpened. S&P500 futures have generated mild gains in the Asian session after a solid recovery on Thursday as investors have cheered signs of policy-tightening termination by the Federal Reserve (Fed) amid banking woes. Two-year US Treasury yields that closely follow the US equities benchmark have dropped below.  3.8%. Also, 10-year yields have dropped below 3.39%, which indicates a sheer improvement in the demand for US government bonds. Also, commentary from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for widening the insurance blanket for deposits has infused some confidence among market participants. The US Secretary Yellen cited that the government is ‘prepared for additional deposits actions if warranted’. Major central banks are saying no to further rate hikes The street has started making long-term bearish bets for the US Dollar as Federal Reserve chairJerome Powelldelivered signs of concluding the year-long rate-hiking spree to avoid any further mess in the banking crisis. Also, rates have reached a point where room for further escalation is less. Like the Federal Reserve, other central banks are also eyeing a pause in the rate-hiking cycle such as the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Above all, the Bank of Canada (BoC) has already paused its policy-tightening cycle, citing that current monetary policy is restrictive enough to tame price pressures. So, it would not be justified to corner the US Dollar for concluding the tightening spell. US Inflation to be hammered by Fed rates and banks' credit tightening The US inflation has been in a declining trend for the past few months as the Federal Reserve has pushed rates significantly to 4.75-5.00% after eight consecutive rate hikes. Room for further rate hikes looks small as Federal Reserve Powell has confirmed only one rate hike for now but a big no to consideration of rate cuts this year. Therefore, higherratesfor a longer period by the Federal Reserve would continue to weigh on inflationary pressures. Apart from that, US banks are likely to be more precautionary while disbursing loans to households and businesses, which would impact the overall demand, inflation, and the scale of economic activities. Bank of England would consider more hikes if inflation remains persistent Bank of England Bailey went for an eleventh consecutive rate hike on Thursday despite global banking shakedown. Out of the seven-member team, Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members Swati Dhingra and Silvana Tenreyro voted for an unchanged monetary policy while others favored a 25bp rate hike. About the surprise jump in February’s inflation, the Bank of England said that the surprise jump in the price index was the outcome of volatile clothing prices, which could prove less persistent. The central bank is very much confident that inflation will start decelerating rapidly from the second quarter. However, the labor shortage and higher food prices might continue to keep inflation at elevated levels. Analysts at Danske Bank consider that both growth and domestic inflation have surprised to the upside and given BoE’s message, they pencil in an additional 25 bps hike in May 2023. On Friday, a decent action is expected from the Cable as preliminary S&P Global PMI (March) figures for the US and the UK will be released. TheManufacturing PMIis expected to trim to 47.0 from the former release of 47.3. And, Service PMI might soften to 50.5 from the prior release of 50.6. As per the consensus, UK Manufacturing PMI would improve to 49.8 from the former release of 49.3. While Services PMI will drop to 53.0 vs. the prior figure of 53.5. GBP/USD technical outlook  GBP/USD is oscillating in a narrow range of 1.2262-1.2336 on an hourly scale after failing to extend recovery further.The Cableis slipped out of the Rising Channel chart pattern but has not weakened yet as the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2278 is still supporting the Pound Sterling.

"AUD/USD picks up bids to refresh intraday high near 0.6690 during early Friday morning. In doing so, the Aussie pair consolidates the weekly losses while bouncing off a two-week-old ascending support line. As the quote’s latest rebound gains support from the bullish MACD signals, further upside towards the 200-DMA hurdle surrounding 0.6760 can’t be ruled out. However, Thursday’s “Gravestone Doji”candlestickjoins steady RSI (14) to challenge the AUD/USD buyers afterward. In a case where the Aussie pair remains firmer past 0.6760, the December 2022 peak surrounding 0.6890, quickly followed by the 0.6900 threshold, could challenge the AUD/USD bulls before giving them control. On the contrary, a downside break of the immediate fortnight-long support line, close to 0.6660 at the latest, isn’t an open invitation to the bears as multiple levels marked in the last four months around 0.6640-30, can challenge the sellers. It’s worth noting that a downward-sloping previous resistance line from February 02, now support around 0.6575, acts as the last defense of the AUD/USD pair buyers, a break of which could drag the quote towards 2022 bottom surrounding 0.6160.

"In the opinion of Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group,EUR/USDcould move into a consolidative phase in the near term. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “EUR rose to a 7-week high of 1.0929 yesterday before pulling back sharply to close lower by 0.23% (1.0830). The sharp pullback amid overbought conditions and waning momentum suggests EUR has likely entered a consolidation phase. Today, EUR is likely to trade sideways a range of 1.0800/1.0900.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our most recent narrative was from Wednesday (22 Mar, spot at 1.0770) wherein we highlighted that ‘upward momentum is beginning to improve but EUR has to break and stay above 1.0800 before a sustained rise is likely’. EUR easily surpassed 1.0800 and yesterday, it rose to 1.0929 before closing lower for the first time in five days (1.0830, -0.23%). Short-term conditions are severely overbought and this could lead to a few days of consolidation first. As long as 1.0740 is not breached, there is potential for EUR to advance further, though the next resistance at 1.0980 could be out of reach this time around.”",1

The price actions appear to be part of a consolidation phase and today, AUD is likely to trade in a range of 0.6655/0.6720.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Two days ago (22 Mar, spot at 0.6700), we stated that the rapid loss in momentum has diminished the odds for AUD to strengthen. There is no change in our view. From here, AUD must break and hold above 0.6760, or the chances of it advancing further will rapidly diminish. On the downside, a break of 0.6640 (no change in 'strong support' level) indicates that the AUD is more likely to trade in a broad consolidation range rather than strengthening.”",1

"The USD/JPY pair extends this week's rejection slide from the 133.00 mark and continues drifting lower for the third successive day on Friday. Spot prices drop to the lowest level since February 10 during the first half of the European session, with bears now looking to extend the downward trajectory further below the 130.00 psychological mark. The Japanese Yen (JPY) strengthens across the board in reaction to the domestic data, showing that an important gauge of Japan’s consumer prices rose at its fastest pace since 1982 in February. In fact, Japan's core-core CPI, which strips out energy and food prices but includes alcoholic beverages, accelerated to 3.5% in February - marking the fastest year-on-year increase in 41 years. This boosts expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will tweak its bond yield control policy in the near term, which, in turn, benefits the domestic currency and continues to exert downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. Bearish traders further take cues from a further decline in the US Treasury bond yields, led by the Federal Reserve's signal that it might soon pause the rate-hiking cycle in the wake of the recent turmoil in the banking sector. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond and the rate-sensitive two-year Treasury note languish near a six-month low touched earlier this week. This results in a further narrowing of the US-Japan rate differential, which is seen as another factor that drives flows towards the JPY and contributes to the heavily offered tone surrounding the USD/JPY pair. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, is gaining some follow-through traction for the second successive day and building on the overnight goodish rebound from a seven-week low. This, in turn, is holding back bearish traders from placing fresh bets around the USD/JPY pair and helping limit the downside, at least for the time being. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to register losses for the fourth straight week and the aforementioned fundamental backdrop supports prospects for an extension of the recent rejection slide from the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Market participants now look forward to the US economic docket, featuring the release of the Durable Goods Orders data and the flashPMIprints for March later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields, might influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to theUSD/JPY pair.

Our call was premature as USD continues to drop as it fell to a low of 130.31 yesterday. Despite the decline, short-term conditions remain severely oversold. However, there is room for USD to weaken further though there are a couple of rather solid support levels at 130.15 and 129.80.

"The GBP/USD pair comes under heavy selling pressure on the last day of the week and retreats further from its highest level since early February, around the 1.2340-1.2345 region touched on Thursday. The selling bias remains unabated through the first half of the European session and drags spot prices back closer to the 1.2200 mark in the last hour. A fresh wave of the global risk-aversion trade - as depicted by a sharp intraday fall in the equity markets - assists the US Dollar (USD) to gain strong follow-through traction on Friday and build on the previous day's goodish rebound from a seven-week low. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor weighing heavily on the GBP/USD pair. The British Pound is further weighed down by the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey's dovish remarks and the disappointing release of the flash UK PMI prints for March. In an interview with BBC on Friday, Bailey noted that there is evidence of encouraging progress on inflation and that companies should bear in mind that BoE forecasts inflation will fall.

"The Bank of England (BoE) raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points. BoE has done a good job, in the opinion of Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research at Commerzbank. BoE did not give even the slightest hint of a less hawkish approach “The BoE has done a good job. I do not mean its monetary policy, but its communication policy. Despite its small rate step of only 25 bps it did not create the impression that its determination to fight inflation has weakened. And that is why yesterday’s BoE decision was neutral for Sterling – contrary to my expectations.” “Contrary to theFed, the British central bankers did not give even the slightest hint of a less hawkish approach. That is why the rate cut was not GBP negative.” ",0
"The AUD/USD pair attracts fresh sellers on Friday and extends the previous day's rejection slide from over a two-week peak, around the 0.6755-0.6760 region, which coincides with a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The intraday downfall drags spot prices to over a one-week low, around the 0.6635 area during the first half of the European session and is sponsored by resurgent US Dollar (USD) demand. In fact, the USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, builds on the previous day's solid bounce from a seven-week low and gains strong follow-through traction amid a sharp fall in the equity markets. The disappointing release of manufacturing PMIs from the Eurozone and the UK revived worries about looming recession risks. This, in turn, takes its toll on the global risk sentiment, which forces investors to take refuge in traditional safe-haven assets, including the Greenback. This comes on the back of data released earlier this Friday, which indicated renewed contraction in Australia's private sector business activity in February and drives flows away from the perceived riskier Aussie. In fact, the gauge for the manufacturing sector dropped to 48.7 in March from the 50.7 previous, while ServicesPMIcame in at 48.2 during the reported month as compared to 50.7 in February. Furthermore, the Composite PMI also dropped to 48.1 in March from February's 50.6 final print. This, along with the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) dovish signal, indicating that a pause in the rate-hiking cycle may be on the cards next month, exerts additional downward pressure on the AUD/USD pair. It, however, remains to be seen if the USD bulls can maintain their dominant position amid the Fed's less hawkish outlook on Wednesday. The US central bank raised interestratesby 25 bps, as expected, though sounded cautious about the outlook in the wake of the recent turmoil in the banking sector. This leads to a further decline in the US Treasury bond yields and could act as a headwind for the Greenback, which should help limit losses for the AUD/USD pair, at least for the time being. Market participants now look forward to the US economic docket, featuring the release of Durable Goods Orders and flash PMI prints for March. This, along with the broader risk sentiment, will influence the USD price dynamics and allow traders to grab short-term opportunities around the pair heading into the weekend.

Loss of support at 1.2260 (minor resistance intraday now ) confers a soft look on the GBP outlook in the short run, however.” “Weakness below the 1.22 point will tip the balance of risks towards a deeper drop to the 1.2075/1.2125 range.” ",0

"The Bank of England (BoE) announced that it raised its policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.25%. The decision barely moved the Pound. Economists at MUFG Bank expectthe GBP/USD pairto see further gains. BoE hiked but the reasoning was less than clear “Given the MPC guidance in February repeated yesterday that ‘if there were to be evidence of more persistent (inflation) pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required’ the decision to hike is from those perspective difficult to explain.” “The BoE did highlight stronger than expected labour demand and due in part to the budget GDP growth was also going to be stronger. But clearly the case for tightening wasn’t compelling but the stronger CPI data overall probably forced the BoE’s hand. We see a good chance now that yesterday’s hike was the last.” “There was not enough in the details for any abrupt shift in market expectations and there’s been minimal impact on GBP. Hence the positive momentum in GBP/USD could continue and we see scope for further gains to the upside from here given the broader less favourable backdrop for the Dollar.” ",1
"The Dollar has been the big loser since the banking turmoil started. Economists at ING expect theEUR/USDto hit 1.15 by the end of the year. Combination of lower Fed rate expectations and improved risk sentiment is negative for USD “There is a possibility that we’ll see a scenario in line with current market conditions, where the US banking situation remains troublesome but doesn’t turn into a fully-fledged systemic crisis, and theFedsticks to some ambiguous communication until a tighter financial environment hits the economy and forces large cuts.” “In this scenario, further Dollar depreciation seems inevitable, and if the EU banking sector remains broadly shielded, stickier inflation in the Eurozone should force more hikes by theECBand ultimately a contraction in the USD-EUR rate differentials.” “Ultimately, EUR/USD should easily break above 1.10, and be on track to touch 1.15 by year-end.” ",1
"The USD/JPY pair remains under heavy selling pressure for the third successive day and touches its lowest level since February 03, around the 129.65 region on Friday. Spot prices, however, trim a part of the intraday losses and trade just above the 130.00 psychological mark during the early North American session, still down nearly 0.50% for the day. The Japanese Yen (JPY) draws support from data showing that an important gauge of Japan’s consumer prices rose at its fastest pace since 1982 in February. Apart from this, a fresh wave of the global risk-aversion trade, amid lingering concerns about a full-blown banking crisis and looming recession risks, provides an additional boost to the safe-haven JPY and drags the USD/JPY pair lower. Furthermore, the narrowing of the US-Japan rate differential, led by the ongoing steep decline in the US Treasury bond yields in the wake of the Federal Reserve's hints of a pause to interest rate hikes, is seen driving flows towards the JPY. That said, a strong broad-based US Dollar (USD) rally lends some support to the USD/JPY pair and helps limit any further losses, at least for the time being. From a technical perspective, the overnight sustained break and acceptance below the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of the January-March rally could be seen as a fresh trigger for bearish traders. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart are holding deep in the negative territory and are still far from being in the oversold zone, which, in turn, supports prospects for a further depreciating move. Hence, any further recovery move is more likely to attract fresh sellers around the 131.00 round-figure mark. This should cap the USD/JPY pair near the 131.30 region, or the 61.8% Fibo. level. That said, some follow-through buying could trigger a short-covering move and lift spot prices to the 132.00 mark. The momentum could get extended towards the 132.50 area, or the 50% Fibo. level. On the flip side, the daily swing low, around the 129.65 region, now seems to protect the immediate downside, below which theUSD/JPY paircould fall to the 129.00 mark.

"The GBP/USD pair comes under intense selling pressure on Friday and extends the overnight retracement slide from the vicinity of mid-1.2300s, or its highest level since February. Spot prices, however, manage to rebound a few pips from the daily low and trade above the 1.2200 mark during the early North American session, still down nearly 0.60% for the day. A fresh wave of the global risk-aversion trade - amid lingering concerns about a full-blown banking crisis - assists the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) to build on the previous day's solid bounce from a seven-week low. Apart from this, the weaker-than-expected release of UKPMIprints for March weighs on the British Pound and further contributes to the heavily offered tone surrounding the GBP/USD pair. That said, the Federal Reserve's hints of a pause to interest rate hikes, along with the anti-risk flow, lead to a further steep decline in the US Treasury bond yields. Furthermore, the disappointing US Durable Goods Orders act as a headwind for the USD and lend some support to the GBP/USD pair. Spot prices, meanwhile, showed some resilience below the 1.2200 resistance-turned-support. The said handle is followed by the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), currently around the 1.2150-1.2145 region, which if broken decisively might prompt some technical selling and pave the way for deeper losses. The GBP/USD pair might then accelerate the fall towards the 1.2100 mark (100-day SMA) before eventually dropping to the next relevant support near the 1.2040 horizontal zone. On the flip side, any meaningful recovery now seems to confront an immediate hurdle near the 1.2270-1.2275 region. A sustained move beyond has the potential to pushthe GBP/USD pairback above the 1.2300 round figure, towards resting the multi-week high, around the 1.2340-1.2345 region touched on Thursday.

The peak total for imports was back in August when natural gas prices peaked with the total import bill at JPY 3,423bn.” “Understandably, theFedand the drop in yields in the US is getting the attention as a key factor in pushing USD/JPY lower but the energy story will certainly add to positive JPY momentum this year.” ",0
"Bank Of England’s (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee member Catherine Mann said on Friday, that she voted at this week’s meeting for a 25 basis point rate hike instead of a bigger increase, motivated in part by the fact that inflation expectations began to moderate, reflecting that monetary policy is having an effect.

"The AUDUSD has exhibited a series of ups and downs since last Friday, with the ""ups"" encountering resistance between 0.67239 and 0.67296 for the majority of the week. Buyers attempted to push the price up on Wednesday and Thursday, driven by volatility from the Fed rate decision. These upward movements managed to surpass the 50% midpoint of the decline from the February 20 high at 0.67417 but fell short of the crucial falling 200-day moving average at 0.67579. Yesterday, the price began to decline, breaking below two key swing areas: between 0.67239 and 0.67296 (red numbered circles), and between 0.6691 and 0.67036. The price low stalled near another swing area between 0.6665 and 0.66732 (green number circles). In today's trading, the initial move to the upside into the European morning session tested the 100-hour moving average (blue line in the chart above), encountering selling pressure. This price point also fell within the swing area between 0.6691 and 0.67036, indicating that sellers remained in control. Sellers have pushed the price down further to a new swing area between 0.6628 and 0.66399, breaking below the week's low from Tuesday at 0.6649. Since then, the price has been fluctuating, reaching a high of 0.66494, near Tuesday's low. The levels around 0.6665 and 0.66732 (green numbered circles in the chart above) are now crucial for determining short-term market bias. To maintain control and target the lower extremes observed between March 7 and March 15, sellers must keep the price below these levels. On the other hand, dip buyers will aim to reclaim the broken levels in order to shift the momentum in their favor.

This wasn’t a straightforward decision.” Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin commented that the situation in the banking sector “felt very stable by the time we got there (to the meeting). So the conditions were right to do monetary policy the way we want to do monetary policy.” On the data front, the US economic calendar featured the S&P Global PMI improved in March, exceeding expectations and the prior’s month data. The Manufacturing Index stood in the contractionary territory. At the same time, Durable Good Orders plunged by 1% but improved compared to the last month’s reading. The UK economic docket featured Retail Sales, which beat estimates on an annual and monthly basis, while the S&P Global PMIs were worse than foreseen. TheManufacturing PMIfailed to improve, while the Services and Composite PMIs, ticked slightly down. Catheryn Mann, a member of the Bank of England, said she voted for a 25 bps rate hike compared to a larger one because she saw signs that inflation expectations are falling. GBP/USD Technical analysis  Given the backdrop, the GBP/USD extended its losses, boosted by a stronger US Dollar. Even though the GBP/USD hit a daily low at 1.2190, buyers could hurdle the 1.2200 mark. It should be said that failure to achieve a daily close above 1.2300 could exacerbate a fall below 1.2200, which could extend to the 20-day EMA around 1.2135. Once cleared, the 200-day EMA would be up for grabs. On the flip side, buyers reclaiming 1.2300 can pave the way to the weekly high of 1.2343. GBP/USD  ",0
"As the New York session finished, EUR/USD fell 0.64% or 69 pips. A risk-on impulse did not help the Euro (EUR), which, pressured by a banking crisis threatening to spread to the Eurozone, weakened the shared currency. At the time of writing, theEUR/USD is tradingat 1.0759. EUR/USD drops on US Dollar strength, weak EU PMIs Despite experiencing another turbulence, the US equities market is poised to finish the week positively. Deutsche Bank’s stock experienced a sharp decline due to concerns over the possibility of default, reflected in a 220 basis point increase in Credit Default Swaps (CDS). Although this harmed Wall Street at the beginning of the session, investors appeared to dismiss these fears and instead speculated that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would lower interest rates in 2023. Wall Street finished the week with gains. Deutsche Bank’s stock experienced a sharp decline due to concerns that the bank may default, as evidenced by the 220 basis point rise in Credit Default Swaps (CDS). Although this initially caused some concern on Wall Street, investors ultimately dismissed these fears, speculating that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would reduce interest rates in 2023. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard expressed that rates should be raised further to reach the 5.50%-5.75% range, which would mean an additional 75 bps of rate hikes on top of the Fed’s recent increase of 4.75%-5.00%. Meanwhile, AtlantaFed President Raphael Bosticcommented that the decision made in March was not easy, as there was a lot of debate and it was not a simple choice. Thomas Barkin, the President of the Richmond Federal Reserve, stated that he felt the banking sector was very stable when they arrived at the meeting. Therefore the conditions were suitable for implementing monetary policy as intended. The S&P GlobalPMIshowed improvement in March, surpassing both expectations and the data from the previous month. Although the Manufacturing Index remained in a state of contraction, Durable Good Orders saw a 1% drop, which was still an improvement compared to the reading from the previous month. In the Euro area (EU), March’s S&P Global PMIs were positive, except for the Manufacturing component, which remained in recessionary territory.European Central Bank(ECB) policymakers crossed news wires, led by the ECB’s President Christine Lagarde, saying there’s no trade-off between price and financial stability. Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel commented that a pause is not in order as inflation, seen averaging around 6% in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, will take too long to come back to the ECB’s 2% target.“Wage developments are likely to prolong the prevailing period of high inflationrates,” Nagel said in Edinburgh. “In other words: Inflation will become more persistent.” EUR/USD Technical analysis  The EUR/USD failed to hold to its previous gains, though the triple bottom chart pattern remains in play as long as it stays above 1.0759. A breach of the latter would invalidate the pattern, and open the door for further losses. On the upside, the first resistance would be 1.0800, followed by the 1.0900 figure, ahead of the YTD high at 1.1032. EUR/USD  ",0

"EUR/USD retreats towards 1.0750 as it consolidates the previous weekly gains amid a cautious mood in the market ahead of the key inflation data from Europe and the US. That said, the Euro pair eases from its intraday high to 1.0765 during early Monday in Asia while fading the late Friday’s corrective bounce. Fears of more banking sector fallout and Russia’s likely usage of nuclear weapons in its war with Ukraine join the hawkish central bank talks to challenge the risk profile. It’s worth noting, however, that the US Dollar managed to pare some of its latest losses despite the downbeat Treasury bond yields. The recent rebound in the greenback could be linked to the slightly positive US data and hopes of faster rate hikes by the Federal Reserve (Fed). However, the hawkish tone of theEuropean Central Bankofficials and an absence of disappointing numbers from the bloc allowed the EUR/USD pair to post weekly gains in the last. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) NATO on Sunday criticised Vladimir Putin for what it called his ""dangerous and irresponsible"" nuclear rhetoric, a day after the Russian president said he planned to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, per Reuters. Elsewhere, the preliminary readings of Eurozone S&P Global PMIs for March showed that the Manufacturing gauge arrived at 47.1 versus 49.0 expected and 48.5 prior but the Services PMI rose to a fresh 10-month high of 55.6 while rising from 52.7 prior and 52.5 expected. As a result, the Composite PMI also rose to a 10-month top of 54.1 versus 51.9 market forecasts and 52.0 previous readings. On the same line were the first readings of Germany’s S&P Global/BME PMIs for March as the Manufacturing gauge dropped to a two-month low of 44.4 versus 47.0 expected and 46.3 prior but the Services PMI rose to 53.9 during the stated month from 50.9 prior and 51.1 expected. Further, the Composite PMI refreshed a 10-month high with the 52.6 figure for March versus 51.0 expected and February’s 50.7. On the other hand, US Durable Goods Orders for February dropped by 1.0% versus January's fall of 5% (revised from -4.5%) and the market expectation for an increase of 0.6%. Details suggested that the figure for Durable Goods Orders ex Defense and ex Transportation were also downbeat but Nondefense Capital Goods Orders ex Aircraft came in firmer-than-expected 0.0% to 0.2%, versus 0.3% prior. Further, the preliminary readings of the US S&P Global PMIs for March came in firmer as the Manufacturing gauge rose to 49.3 from 47.3 in February, versus 47.0 expected, while Services PMI rose to 53.8 from 50.6 prior and 50.5 expected.

Talking about the central bankers’ comments, On Friday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told NPR that it was not an easy decision to raise the policy rate while also adding that he is not expecting the economy to fall into recession. ""Fed has to get inflation under control,” said Fed’s Bostic. Further, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, a policy hawk, said on Friday that the response to the bank stress was swift and appropriate, allowing the monetary policy to focus on inflation, per Reuters. The policymaker also added that the projections suggest one more rate hike that could be at the next FOMC meeting or soon after. It should be noted that the latest comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari seem to weigh on the US Dollar as he said during CBS show Face the Nation that recent stress in the banking sector and the possibility of a follow-on credit crunch brings the US closer to recession. In the case of the ECB officials, ECB President Christine Lagarde told EU leaders on Friday that the Euro area banking sector is resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions, Reuters reported citing EU officials. “ECB is determined to bring back inflation to 2%, will decide on futureratesbased on incoming data,” added ECB’s Lagarde. On the same line was Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe who said that European banks have enough capital andliquidity. Further, ECB policymaker Joachim Nagel said on Friday, “It will be necessary to raise policy rates to sufficiently restrictive levels in order to bring inflation back down to 2% in a timely manner.” During the weekend, ECB Board Member Isabel Schnabel said that while headline inflation has begun falling, the core is sticky. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed with mild gains after late Friday’s losses while the yields bounce off weekly lows. Looking ahead, IFO numbers for Germany will join the comments from the ECB and the Fed officials to direct the EUR/USD pair’s intraday moves. However, major attention will be given to the inflation data from Germany and Europe.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve (Fed) implemented a 25-basis point rate hike, and Fed ChairJerome Powellreassured the market that all necessary steps would be taken to alleviate theliquiditycrisis in the banking sector. However, panic ensued as Deutsche Bank's credit default swap began to surge, leading to investor unease and increased risk in the market. On Friday, Fed's Bullard emphasized the importance of reducing inflation despite current financial stability concerns. He acknowledged that the Committee could use macroprudential policy to mitigate financial distress if necessary. Fed's Barkin shared a similar view, noting tight labor markets and high inflation, and agreed that this week's rate hikes were justified. In economic data, February's US Durable Goods experienced a 1.0% decline, contrary to the anticipated 0.6% increase. The US S&P Global FlashPMIfor March exceeded expectations for Manufacturing and Services, pushing the Composite Index to 53.3 from 50.1. Manufacturing remains in contraction while services continue to expand. Market focus now shifts to Friday's upcoming US Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), Personal Income, and Spending data. Core PCE is expected to rise by 0.4% MoM in February, slower than January's 0.6% increase. The annual rate of core PCE is predicted to moderate to 4.3% YoY from 4.7%. US Personal Income is anticipated to increase by 0.3% MoM in February, slowing down compared to the 0.6% MoM growth in January. Personal Spending is also expected to rise by 0.3% MoM, a more moderate pace than the previous 1.8% increase. Developments in the global banking sector will be crucial to monitor, as they may significantly impactmarket sentimentand trends.

Talking about the data, US Durable Goods Orders for February dropped by 1.0% versus January's fall of 5% (revised from -4.5%) and the market expectation for an increase of 0.6%.

Moving on, AUD/USD traders may witness further consolidation on Monday amid a lack of major data/events. However, the cautious mood ahead of this week’s Aussie Retail Sales, monthly inflation and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, could test the pair’s upside momentum. It’s worth noting that the Reserve Bank of Australia officials have mostly been cautious of late and hence softening the inflation signals could keep the sellers in the driver’s seat.

However, a convergence of the 50-DMA and the 10-DMA, around 1.0730, appears a tough nut to crack for the EUR/USD bears, especially amid bullish MACD signals. Even if the quote drops below 1.0730, tops marked during early March around 1.690 could challenge the pair sellers before directing them to an upward-sloping support line from early January, around 1.0560 by the press time.

Even so, multiple tops marked around 1.0930 becomes crucial for the bulls to tackle before eyeing the yearly high surrounding 1.1033.

Bloomberg reported that US authorities are considering an expansion of the emergency lending facility that would offer banks more support, and will provide the First Republic Bank more time to shore up its balance sheet. S&P500 futures have loaded up some decent gains after a positive week on hopes that emergency lending support to mid-size banks will provide them room for more business. Also, more financial support to small US banks after declining deposits post-banking fiasco would help them to restore the confidence of households.

In doing so, the Aussie pair licks its wounds after posting the weekly loss but lacks recovery momentum to extend the late Friday’s corrective bounce off a one-week low. It should be noted that the AUD/USD pair’s confirmation of a two-week-old rising wedge bearish chart formations joins the bearish MACD signals and downbeat RSI (14), not oversold, to keep sellers hopeful. That said, the latest trough surrounding 0.6625 lures intraday sellers of the Aussie pair before highlighting the monthly low of 0.6564. Following that, the theoretical target of rising wedge confirmation, surrounding 0.6650, joins the October 2022 peak of near 0.6645, to offer strong support to the sellers. On the flip side, the 100-bar Simple Moving Average (SMA), near 0.6670 at the latest, guards immediate recovery moves of the AUD/USD pair before the stated wedge’s lower line, around 0.6680. Even if the Aussie pair crosses the 0.6680 support-turned-resistance, the wedge’s top line and the 200-SMA, respectively near 0.6750 and 0.6760, could challenge the bulls.

In doing so,the Cablepair crosses a two-day-old descending resistance line, now immediate support around 1.2240. It’s worth noting that the bullish MACD signals and gradually recovering RSI (14), not overbought also underpin the latest rebound in the Cable pair, which in turn suggests the quote’s further advances. However, the 100-Hour Moving Average (HMA) restricts the immediate upside of the GBP/USD price to around the 1.2260 level.

"USD/JPY pleases bears for the fourth consecutive day even as markets remain inactive during early Monday. The Yen pair’s latest weakness could be linked to the traders’ rush towards the Japanese Yen (JPY) in search of risk safety, as well as looming fears surrounding the banking industry in the US and Europe. It’s worth noting that the recent divergence between the market’s bias about the next moves of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) also seems to weigh on the quote of late. Although Bloomberg came out with inspiring headlines suggesting that the US and European policymakers are up for taming the bank fallouts, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that “risks to financial stability have increased.” Also raising the market’s fears was the news suggesting Russia’s shifting of nuclear weapons near Belarus. However, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari flagged fears of US recession and tamed calls for more rate hikes from the US central bank, which in turn exerts downside pressure on the Yen pair. It should be noted that Friday’s mixed details of the US Durable Goods Orders and Purchasing Managers’ Index for February and March respectively joined the hawkishFedspeak to trigger the USD/JPY pair’s corrective bounce off the multi-day low. Above all, the escalating chatters of the BoJ’s exit from the ultra-lose monetary policy, in contrast to the Fed’s nearness to policy pivot, directs USD/JPY towards the south. Amid these plays, stocks in the Asia-Pacific zone trade mixed while S&P 500 Futures rise half a percent to track Friday’s mildly positive Wall Street performance. That said, the benchmark US 10-year Treasury bond yields seesaw around 3.378% while the two-year counterpart picks up bids with mild intraday gains of around 3.797%. Moving on,USD/JPY pairmay seek more clues from risk catalysts amid a lightcalendar, which in turn suggests further grinding of the quote towards the south.

Following that, Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, will be observed closely.

"AUD/USD has faced immense pressure after a gradual recovery to near 0.6660 in the early European session. The Aussie asset has sensed meaningful offers amid a recovery move bythe US Dollar Index(DXY). The Australian Dollar is likely to remain in action ahead of the release of the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is scheduled for Wednesday. S&P500 futures have made stellar gains in the morning session on Monday on hopes of expansion inliquidityassistance to small United States banks. The 500-US stocks futures basket has continued its Friday’s bullish bias, portraying significant improvement in therisk appetiteof the market participants. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is defending the 103.00 support on expectations that upbeat preliminary S&P Global PMI could fade the expectations of a termination of the rate-hiking spell by the Federal Reserve (Fed).Manufacturing PMIjumped to 49.3 vs. the consensus of 47.0 and the former release of 47.3. While Services PMI accelerated to 53.8 against the estimates of 50.5 and the prior release of 50.6. In addition to that, the demand for US government bonds has eased marginally, which has resulted in a minor recovery in 10-year US Treasury yields above 3.38%. Meanwhile, two-year US Treasury yields that track US equities firmly have stretched their recovery above 3.38%, indicating some pressure on risk-sensitive assets ahead. Mixed views on US banking turmoil The street is full of terror about theeconomic outlookof the United States economy after the banking sector turmoil. The collapse of three mid-size US banks was sufficient to dampen the confidence of investors. Fears of banking fiasco have extended to households, which have trimmed their deposits from small US banks dramatically. Reuters reported on Friday that the data from Federal Reserve (Fed) shows that deposits at small U.S. banks dropped by a record amount following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Therefore, US authorities have come forward to widen the blanket of support to US mid-size banks by expanding the emergency liquidity facility. This has provided a small time relief, however, the situation is likely to get vulnerable further. Speaking at the China Development Forum over the weekend, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that “risks to financial stability have increased.” She further added, 2023 would be another challenging year, with global growth slowing to 2.9% due to the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and monetary tightening. Precautionary moves from US banks in advancing loans to households and businesses have propelled the risk of a US recession. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari cited on Sunday, “Recent stress in the banking sector and the possibility of a follow-on credit crunch brings the US closer to recession. It definitely brings us closer."" It would be a tough call from theFedto bring more interest rates if recession fears are potential. Australian Retail Sales and Consumer Price Index to remain in the limelight A power-pack action is expected from the Australian Dollar as the release of the monthly Retail Sales and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will remain key event this week. Tuesday’s Retail Sales (Feb) data is expected to expand by 0.4% lower than the former expansion of 1.9%. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is extremely worried about persistent inflation and a softening retail demand would provide some relief to policymakers. It is worth noting that the Reserve Bank of Australia provided cues about the consideration of a pause in the rate-hiking spell from its April monetary meeting after a significant decline in monthly CPI data. Reserve Bank of AustraliaGovernor Philip Lowehas already pushedratesto 3.60%, On Wednesday, the monthly CPI will be the key highlight. For February, the monthly figure was recorded at 7.4%. AUD/USD technical outlook  AUD/USD is auctioning in an Inverted Flag chart pattern on an hourly scale. An Inverted Flag is a trend-following pattern that displays a long consolidation that is followed by a breakdown. Usually, the consolidation phase of the chart pattern serves as an inventory adjustment in which those participants initiate shorts, which prefer to enter an auction after the establishment of a bearish bias. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6600 is acting as a major barricade for the Australian Dollar.

"TheEUR/USDpair is displaying topsy-turvy moves in a narrow range below 1.0800 in the early European session. The major currency pair is struggling to find direction as investors are in a fix about further action in the FX domain due to a light economic calendar this week. The Euro is not shown any action despite renewed Russia-Ukraine concerns. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on the weekend that Russia plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus. He further added, “We're not transferring our nuclear weapons to Belarus but will station them there as the United States does in Europe.” Meanwhile,the US Dollar Index(DXY) is continuously auctioning sideways after a gradual correction to near 103.00. Investors are mixed about further action from the Federal Reserve (Fed) as upbeat preliminary S&P GlobalPMIindicates that the central bank could continue tightening policy further. While tight credit conditions from small US banks after the fiasco have solidified the risk of recession in the US. EUR/USD is looking for a cushion near the demand zone placed in a range of 1.0733-1.0760 on a four-hour scale. The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.0750 is providing a cushion for the Euro bulls. The ultimate resistance is plotted from February 01 high at 1.1033. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has taken support around 40.00, and a reversal move is highly anticipated. For further upside, the shared currency pair needs to surpass February 14 low at 1.0805, which will drive the asset toward January 18 high at 1.0887 and the round-level resistance at 1.0900. On the flip side, a downside break below March 17 low at 1.0612 would drag the shared currency pair toward March 16 low at 1.0551, followed by March 15 low at 1.0516.

"In the opinion of Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group,GBP/USDshould keep the side-line theme well in place for the time being. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Our view for GBP to trade in a range last Friday was incorrect as it dropped sharply to 1.2192 before rebounding. The rebound in oversold conditions suggest GBP is unlikely to weaken much further. Today, GBP is more likely to trade sideways, expected to be 1.2200 and 1.2300.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have expected GBP to advance since the start of last week. In our most recent update from last Friday (24 Mar, spot at 1.2275), we stated that ‘While GBP strength is still intact, short-term upward momentum is beginning to wane, and this combined with overbought conditions suggests 1.2400 may be out of reach this time around’. In London trade, GBP dropped sharply to a low of 1.2192. While our ‘strong support’ level at 1.2190 is not breached, upward momentum has more or less fizzled out. In other words, the week-long GBP strength has ended. The current movement is likely part of a consolidation phase. From here, GBP could trade within a range of 1.2140/1.2340.”",0
"The USD/JPY experienced a sharp rebound after finding support at the 130.00 mark. The significant drop after reaching the March high of 138.00 for the pair on a daily timeframe is a clear reflection of the falling US Treasury (UST) bond yields. Amid the ongoing banking adversity, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has signaled a pause, leading to a broad-based US Dollar weakness. In addition, the banking turmoil has ignited fresh safe-haven demand for the Japanese Yen. With a downside bias intact, the USD/JPY's upward momentum is likely to remain limited. The first resistance for the pair is situated at Wednesday's high of 132.50, which also coincides with the 50-Day Moving Average (DMA). A convincing break above this level could lead the pair to confront the next resistance, a multi-tested broken resistance line coinciding with the 21-DMA. A strong reversal in price or sudden surge in US Dollar demand could propel the USD/JPY to the March high of 138.00, a key psychological level. On the other hand, the first support is seen at the 130.00 round figure, followed by the March low at the 129.75 mark. The final support zone is situated around the 128.00 mark.The fundamental picture for the USD/JPY portrays a downside bias, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals a possible pullback due to slightly oversold conditions. The pair could experiencevolatilitybased on any fresh developments in the banking sector, and later in the week, the market will carefully watch the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data release.

"The GBP/USD pairbuilds on Friday's late intraday rebound from sub-1.2200 levels and gains some positive traction on the first day of a new week. The pair maintains its bid tone through the early part of the European session and is currently trading around mid-1.2200s, up nearly 0.15% for the day. A further recovery in the US Treasury bond yields is seen lending some support to the US Dollar (USD) and turning out to be a key factor acting as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. That said, the Federal Reserve's signal that it might soon pause the rate-hiking cycle in the wake of the recent turmoil in the banking sector should cap any meaningful upside for the US bond yields. Apart from this, a generally positive risk tone - as depicted by a fresh leg up in the US equity futures - keeps a lid on any the safe-haven Greenback and remains supportive of the bid tone surrounding the major. News that First Citizens Bank & Trust Company will buy all of Silicon Valley Bank's deposits and loans from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) calmed market nerves about the contagion risk and boost investors' confidence. Traders, however, remain worried about a full-blown banking crisis. In fact, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Kristalina Georgieva warned over the weekend that risks to financial stability have increased. This, along with Russia's decision to shift nuclear weapons near Belarus, continues to keep a lid on any optimism in the markets. In the absence of any relevant economic data, either from the UK or the US, the aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution for aggressive traders and before placing fresh directional bets around the GBP/USD pair. That said, the Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey's scheduled speech later during the US session might influence the British Pound and provide some meaningful impetus to the major. Meanwhile, the focus will remain glued to the release of the US Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - due on Friday. From a technical perspective the pair is rangebound in the short term, with a cieling likely to provide resistance at 1.2435 and a floor to give support at circa 1.1790. GBP/USD is currently in an upleg within the range. A break above the 1.2345 level will probably signal a continuation up to the cieling. Alternatively a break below the 1.2175 swing low of March 21 would probably indicate the start of a downleg, potentially back all the way to the range floor. The trend prior to the formation of the sideways consolidation was bullish, indicating a slightly higher chance of a breakout higher.

"Further decline inUSD/JPYnow appears on the cards below the 129.60 level, comment Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted last Friday that ‘there is potential for USD to break 130.15’ but we were of the view that ‘the next support at 129.80 is unlikely to come under threat’. The anticipated USD weakness exceeded our expectations as USD dropped to 129.67 and then rebounded strongly to end the day little changed at 130.69 (-0.09%). The strong bounce in oversold conditions suggests that the downside risk has faded. Today, USD is likely to consolidate, expected to be in a range of 130.20/131.40.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Last Friday (24 Mar, spot at 130.65), we stated that ‘there is room for USD to weaken further though there are a couple of rather solid support levels at 130.15 and 129.80’. We did not expect the sharp but short-lived decline as USD dropped to 129.67 before rebounding strongly. Further USD weakness is not ruled out but USD has to break and stay below 129.60 before further decline is likely. The likelihood of USD breaking clearly below 129.60 will remain intact as long as it does not move above 132.00 (‘strong resistance’ level previously at 132.50).”",0

On the latter, Business Climate in Germany tracked by the IFO Institute improved to 93.3 for the month of March (from 91.1).

"TheUSD/JPY pairbuilds on Friday's goodish recovery from the 129.65 area, or its lowest level since February 03 and gains some follow-through traction on the first day of a new week. The positive momentum remains uninterrupted through the first half of the European session and lifts spot prices to a fresh daily high, around the mid-131.00s in the last hour. A generally positive tone around the equity markets undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY), which, in turn, is seen as a key factor acting as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. News that First Citizens Bank & Trust Company will buy all of Silicon Valley Bank's deposits and loans from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) calm market nerves about the contagion risk. Moreover, reports that US authorities were in the early stage of deliberation about expanding emergency lending facilities boost investors' appetite for perceived riskier assets. The risk-on flow, along with easing fears of a full-blown banking crisis, lead to a further rally in the US Treasury bond yields. This results in the widening of the US-Japan rate differential, which is seen as another factor weighing on the JPY and providing an additional boost to the USD/JPY pair. That said, the Federal Reserve's signal that it might soon pause the rate-hiking cycle in the wake of the recent turmoil in the banking sector holds back the US Dollar (USD) bulls from placing fresh bets. This, in turn, might keep a lid on any meaningful appreciating move for the major. It is worth recalling that the US central bank raised interestratesby 25 bps on Wednesday, as was widely anticipated, though sounded cautious on outlook. Apart from this, expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will tweak its bond yield control policy and whittle down its massive stimulus under new Governor Kazuo Ueda might contribute to capping gains for the USD/JPY pair.

Investors breathe a sigh of relief in reaction to the news that First Citizens Bank & Trust Company will buy all of Silicon Valley Bank's deposits and loans from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This is evident from a generally positive tone around the equity markets, which fails to assist the safe-haven US Dollar (USD) to capitalize on last week's goodish rebound from its lowest level since February and lends support to the GBP/USD pair. The Greenback is further undermined by the Federal Reserve's hints of a possible pause to its rate-hiking cycle in the wake of the recent turmoil in the banking sector. That said, a strong follow-through rally in the US Treasury bond yields acts as a tailwind for the buck, which, in turn, might keep a lid on any meaningful upside for the GBP/USD pair. Hence, any subsequent move is more likely to confront stiff resistance near the 1.2300 round-figure mark. Technicalindicatorson the daily chart, meanwhile, are holding in the positive zone and are still far from being in the overbought territory. This, in turn, suggests that some follow-through buying should pave the way for additional gains and a move towards retesting the monthly peak, around the 1.2340-1.2345 region. The positive momentum could get extended further and allow the GBP/USD pair to aim back to reclaim the 1.2400 round-figure mark.

The steady intraday move-up remains uninterrupted through the early North American session and lifts spot prices to a fresh daily peak, around the 131.75 region in the last hour. The risk-on impulse undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY), which is further weighed down by the widening of the US-Japan rate differential amid a strong rally in the US Treasury bond yields.

Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart - though they have been recovering from lower levels - are still far from being in positive territory and warrant some caution before placing bullish bets around the USD/JPY pair.

In February, sellers entered near this level, but the price also broke above it, reaching the February high at 1.23428.

"EUR/USD snaps two straight days of losses and climbs after hitting a daily low of 1.0744 amidst a subdued session. Despite high US Treasury bond yields, risk-appetite improvement and a softer US Dollar (USD) opened the door for further Euro (EUR) upside. At the time of writing, theEUR/USD is tradingat 1.0789 above its opening price. US equity markets are mixed, with the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 rising while the Nasdaq tumbles. Market participants cheered First Citizens BancShare’s takeover of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), while US authorities are considering expanding emergency lending facilities to First Republic Bank. Data-wise, the March US DallasFedManufacturing Index plunged -15.7, more than February’s -13.5 collapse and worse than the -10.9 estimate. Delving into the data, the Production Index and the Employment component rose. New Orders declined, and the Price Index fell from 15.5 to 7.0. US Treasury bond yields recovered, with 2s meandering around 4%, while the 10-year benchmark note rate sits at 3.515%, gaining thirteen basis points. The greenback has failed to capitalize on the US bond yields rise, withthe US Dollar Index(DXY) sliding 0.19% at 102.915. On the Eurozone (EU) front,European Central Bank(ECB) speakers are crossing the wires. Nagel acknowledged the increasing importance of taking a meeting-by-meeting approach, though he emphasized that the path of monetary policy normalization would continue. He added that QT would accelerate soon. On the flip side, ECB’s de Cos took a cautious approach due to high levels of uncertainty in the financial markets. Of late, ECB’s board member Isabel Schnabel commented that she wanted to signal that further rate hikes were possible, according to people who know the matter. EUR/USD Technical analysis  Technically speaking, the EUR/USD is neutral to upward biased, with a triple bottom staying in play as long as the EUR/USD remains above 1.0759. Oscillators are giving mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) favors EUR/USD upside, while the Rate of Chance (RoC) suggests that buying pressure is waning. The path of least resistance is upwards; therefore, the EUR/USD first resistance would be 1.0800. Once broken, the EUR/USD’s next ceiling would be 1.0929, followed by the 1.1000 figure. EUR/USD  ",0

"The AUD/USD pair is demonstrating a back-and-forth action below 0.6660 from Friday’s session. The sideways performance in the Aussie asset is expected to conclude and a power-pack action will be witnessed. Sheervolatilityis expected in the Australian Dollar after the release of Tuesday’s Retail Sales and Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Tuesday’s Retail Sales (Feb) data is expected to expand by 0.4% lower than the former expansion of 1.9%. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is extremely worried about persistent inflation in the Australian economy and a softening retail demand would provide some relief to policymakers. However, the important catalyst is the monthly CPI data, which is likely to ease to 7.1% from the former release of 7.4%. RBA policymakers have already stated that there is evidence that indicates that Australian inflation has started easing. And, the RBA could terminate its policy-tightening process from April’s monetary meeting as the current monetary policy is restrictive enough to tame the stubborn inflation. Meanwhile, S&P500 settled Monday’s trading session with decent gains on hopes that theUnited Statesbanking system will be bailed out as US authorities are making significant efforts by expandingliquidityassistance, portraying a solidrisk appetitetheme.

"EUR/USD extends the week-start recovery to 1.0800 during early Asian session on Tuesday, picking up bids to refresh the intraday high of late, as the risk-on mood joins the hawkish comments from theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) officials. Adding strength to the Euro pair’s run-up are the firmer data from Germany, Europe’s powerhouse, as well as the recent comments from the Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor. Market sentimentimproved as the European and the US authorities announced the extension of emergency lending to banks. Adding strength to the optimism were comments from the central bank officials pushing back the banking crisis concerns and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) deal. That said, the upbeat prints of Germany’s IFO data for March also favored the EUR/USD bulls. On Monday, Germany’s IFO Business Climate Index rose to a 13-month high of 93.3 for March versus 90.9 market forecasts and 91.1 prior. Further, the IFO’s gauges of Current Assessment and Expectations also increased to 95.4 and 91.2 in that order during the said month compared to respective expected figures of 94.1 and 88.0, versus 93.9 and 88.4 previous readings. Further, hawkish ECB talks were also part of the bullish ammunition for the pair. ECB policymaker, Pablo Hernandez de Cos, said on Monday, “Future monetary policy decisions will depend on three factors, such as new economic and financial data and core inflation.” The policymaker also said that tensions in financial markets have generated a further tightening of financial conditions, affecting the outlook for economic activity and inflation. On the same line, ECB Governing Council member Gediminas Šimkus said that the bank liquidity and capitalization are high in the euro area while also adding, “Financial stability is an important factor.” It’s worth noting that Governing Council member Isabel Schnabel said on Monday that they have no real concern about financial stability risks but added that the situation is still fragile. Additionally, ECB policymaker Mario Centeno said that the wage increase in the Eurozone is still compatible with the monetary policy and added that they are not observing and second round effect on wage-setting. Also positive was S&P Global’s announcement on Monday that it revised the 2023 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecast for Eurozone to 0.3% from 0% previously. However, S&P Global also anticipates Eurozone GDP to grow by 1% in 2024, down from 1.4% expected in the previousforecast. On the other hand, the latest comments from Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson and the US Dollar’s safe-haven demand could be linked to the EUR/USD run-up, not to forget downbeat US data. “Inflation ‘has started to come down’ with some of that due to tighter monetary policy and some due to other factors such as improving global supply chains,” said Fed’s Jefferson. Also, the US DallasFedManufacturing Business Index dropped to -15.7 in March versus -10.9 expected and -13.5 prior. While portraying therisk appetite, Wall Street closed mixed, losing some of the intraday gains in the late hours, whereas yields rebound after a four-week downtrend. Looking ahead, EUR/USD pair traders should keep their eyes on ECB President Christine Lagarde’s speech and the US Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence for clear directions. That said, bulls will be more interested in seeking a further normalization of the banking sector, as well as inflation run-up in the bloc, not to forget softer US data.

"TheUSD/JPYcurrency pair has found stability above the 131.50 mark as US Treasury (UST) bond yields rise. The US Dollar has reached a five-day high against the Japanese Yen due to US authorities' efforts to alleviate concerns surrounding the global banking system, which has helped calm investors. After dropping to the 129.64 mark, USD/JPY reversed asmarket sentimentimproved amid the ongoing banking crisis. Global banking stocks, which had been negatively impacted this month after the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, experienced relief on Monday. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that First Citizens BancShares Inc would acquire all Silicon Valley Bank's deposits and loans from the regulator. According to Bloomberg, US regulators are considering expanding an emergency lending facility for banks in ways that would grant First Republic Bank (FRC) additional time to strengthen its balance sheet. This news has reduced concerns, leading the US Dollar to gain ground against the Japanese Yen as investors scaled back their demand for the safe-haven Yen. Despite positive developments in the banking sector and rising UST bond yields, the US Dollar has remained in a narrow range against most of its counterparts. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) increased interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) as anticipated but maintained a cautious outlook due to the banking sector turmoil. However, Fed ChairJerome Powellleft the possibility of further rate hikes on the table if necessary. Market expectations for the US Dollar may remain subdued, as investors are pricing approximately a 55% chance that the Fed will keep interestratesunchanged at its next meeting in May. Additionally, they anticipate a possible rate cut as early as July. Earlier comments from Federal Reserve Board Governor Philip Jefferson highlighted that inflation has been more persistent and higher than desired. Recent Fed commentary has emphasized addressing inflation above the ongoing banking crisis. TheUS calendarwill feature the Goods Trade Balance for February on Tuesday. Later this week, the market focus will shift toward the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data, which could provide further direction for the USD/JPY currency pair.

"GBP/USD remains on the front foot as bulls attack the 1.2300 mark during Tuesday’s Asian session, following an upbeat start of the week. In doing so, the Cable pair stretches the previous run-up from the 50-bar Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of the quote’s January-March downside. Adding strength to the upside bias could be the impending bulls cross on the MACD. However, the previous week’s confirmation of the rising wedge bearish chart pattern keeps the Cable pair sellers hopeful unless the quote stays below the previous support line of the wedge, near 1.2330 by the press time. Following that, the stated wedge’s top line near the 1.2400 round figure and multiple hurdles near the 1.2420-25 area can test the GBP/USD pair’s further upside ahead of directing it to the Year-To-Date (YTD) top surrounding 1.2450. On the flip side, the 50-SMA and the aforementioned key Fibonacci ratio can challenge short-term GBP/USD bears around 1.2220 and 1.2200 respectively. In a case wherethe Cablepair remains bearish past 1.2200, the 50% Fibonacci retracement and 200-SMA can test the downside moves around 1.2125 and 1.2080 in that order before directing bears towards the 1.2000 psychological magnet.

Also read:Aussie Retail Sales in line, AUD/USD prints session high Contrary to the downbeat data, receding fears of banking fallouts allow the AUD/USD pair to remain firmer for the second consecutive day. Market sentiment initially improved after the US and European policymakers stretched emergency credit lines to the troubled banks and announced deposit insurance schemes. Recently adding strength to the risk-on mood were comments from the central bank officials pushing back the banking crisis concerns and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) deal. That said, Australia’s Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones tried to restore themarket sentimentin the Aussie banks early Tuesday while speaking on local radio. The policymaker said, “Australia’s banking system is resilient,” while also adding that Australia's financial system is well-equipped to deal with challenges in the global economy. On the other hand, the latest comments from Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson and the US Dollar’s safe-haven demand could be linked to the AUD/USD pair’s run-up, not to forget downbeat US data. “Inflation ‘has started to come down’ with some of that due to tighter monetary policy and some due to other factors such as improving global supply chains,” said Fed’s Jefferson.  Further, Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr's prepared testimony to Congress also favored the firmer sentiment as it read, “We are prepared to use all of our tools for any size institution as needed to keep the system safe"". On the same line were comments from the US Treasury stating that the US will keep using tools to prevent banking contagion as needed. It should be noted that the US DallasFedManufacturing Business Index dropped to -15.7 in March versus -10.9 expected and -13.5 prior. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures print mild gains while the US Treasury bond yields recover after a three-week downtrend. Having witnessed the initial reaction to Australia’s Retail Sales, AUD/USD pair traders may wait for comments from Assistant Governor (Economic) at the Reserve Bank of Australia, Luci Ellis for the further run-up. Should the policymaker praises the latest data and push back the dovish concerns, the Aussie pair may have further upside to trace. On the other hand, the US Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence for March will join the second-tier housing and activity data to entertain the pair traders. However, major attention will be given to Wednesday’s Monthly Inflation for Australia and Friday’s Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index.

The asset has observed significant offers led by an extended correction inthe US Dollar Index(DXY). The USD Index has stretched its downside to near 102.60 quickly as banking instability in theUnited Stateshas started easing. After the expansion of emergency liquidity assistance and the announcement of the acquisition of deposits and loans of failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) by First Citizens BancShares, Treasury Undersecretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang stated, “The US government will continue using its tools to prevent contagion in the banking sector, as warranted, to ensure Americans’ deposits are safe,” as reported by Reuters. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures have generated minimal gains after a positive Monday asliquidityassurance from US authorities for a potential banking crisis has infused confidence among the market participants, portraying a risk-on mood. USD/JPY has sensed selling pressure from the upper portion of the Falling Channel chart pattern formed on a four-hour scale. In a Falling Channel chart pattern, every pullback is considered a selling opportunity by the market participants. The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 131.80 is acting as a major barricade for the US Dollar bulls. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the bearish range of 20.00-60.00 and has not shown any sign of a reversal yet. A break below March 27 low at 130.50 would drag the asset towards March 24 low at 129.64 followed by the horizontal support plotted from February 02 low at 128.08.

" EUR/USD bulls take a breather around the intraday high of near 1.0815 as traders seek more clues to extend the two-day run-up during early Tuesday. It’s worth noting that the comparatively upbeat catalysts from Eurozone versus the US joined the risk-on mood to underpin the Euro pair’s latest run-up. Recently, US Treasury Department said that the US will keep using tools to prevent banking contagion as needed.  Before that, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr showed readiness to tame the banking crisis while signaling ease in the inflation woes. On the other hand,European Central Bank(ECB) policymaker Pablo Hernandez de Cos, Gediminas Šimkus, Isabel Schnabel and Mario Centeno were the latest officials who tried to convince markets of easing recession fears in the bloc, as well as hopes of overcoming the banking crisis. It’s worth noting, however, theFedpolicymakers appeared slightly less hawkish than their ECB counterparts in the latest commentaries and hence allowed the EUR/USD bulls to rise further. Furthermore, Monday’s downbeat US Dallas Fed Manufacturing Business Index for March contrasted with Germany’s strong IFO data for the said month to offer additional strength to the EUR/USD bulls. Meanwhile, the geopolitical fears surrounding China and Russia challenge the market’s upbeat sentiment, as well as the EUR/USD bulls. That said, talks about China’s failure to keep the pace of growth promised, as well as Russia’s alleged readiness to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. On the same line are the latest comments from North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un who recently stated, per KCNA news, “(They) should be fully ready to use nuclear weapons at any time.” Recently, Russia was said to have test-fired antiship missile in the Sea of Japan. Against this backdrop, S&P 500 Futures print mild gains around 4,010 during the four-day uptrend whereas the US Treasury bond yields remain sidelined after snapping a three-day downtrend on Monday. It’s worth noting that the US 10-year and two-year Treasury yields grind higher around 3.53% and 3.93% by the press time. That said,the US Dollar Index(DXY) drops for the second consecutive day to 102.65, down 0.21% intraday by the press time. Looking forward, the US Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence for March, as well as the second-tier housing and activity data, can direct intraday moves of the EUR/USD pair.

The US Dollar Index is likely to continue its downside momentum further amid the absence of recovery signals near 102.60.

Demand for US government bonds has shown some rebound after an intense sell-off on Monday. Investors dumped US government bonds after back-to-back positive headlines from US authorities for providing liquidity assistance to small US banks after the fiasco of three banks. The 10-year US Treasury yields have dropped to near 3.51%. United States government to bail out banking sector The debacle of three mid-size banks resulted in the loss of confidence of households in mid-size banking organizations. Reuters reported on Monday that households have withdrawn their deposits heavily from small US banks and firms are heavily relying on advances from them, which has made them prone to meltdown. To contain the same, the US government came forward with an expansion of emergencyliquidityassistance to small lenders. The headline was followed by the announcement of the acquisition of deposits and loans from failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) by First Citizens BancShares. The idea of bailing out SVB is going to deliver a message that the overall banking system is strong, resilient, and sufficient enough to face turbulence. Apart from that, US Treasury Undersecretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang stated, “The US government will continue using its tools to prevent contagion in the banking sector, as warranted, to ensure Americans’ deposits are safe,” as reported by Reuters. Positive steps from the US government for bailing out collapsed banks and restoring of confidence of investors and households have impacted the US Dollar. Investors split about Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision After an eight consecutive rate hike by the Federal Reserve (Fed), interestrateshave knocked the 5% figure. Federal Reserve chairJerome Powellshowed bravery and hiked rates further by 25 basis points (bps) despite fears of a banking sector meltdown. However, the further road to inflation containment looks tricky. The investing community is split about whether the Federal Reserve will keep policy unchanged or will continue its policy-tightening spell. As per the CME Fedwatch tool, more than 50% of investors are advocating for the maintenance of a status quo by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in its May monetary policy meeting as tight credit conditions approach by US banks would actively weigh on US inflation. The approach has heavily impacted the USD index. Australian Retail Sales reveal weaker Retail Sales In the morning of Asia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Retail Sales have expanded by 0.2%, lower than the consensus of 0.4% and the former release of 1.9%. A weaker-than-expected retail demand indicates that households are bearing the burden of higher inflation and are facing issues in offsetting the impact of inflated products with current paying capacity. Although Australian households are going through a rough phase, weak retail demand is music to the ears for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The central bank has been working on softening Australian inflation, which is extremely stubborn and not responding well to higher interest rates. Till now, Reserve Bank of Australia chairPhilip Lowehas already pushed the Official Cash Rate (OCR) to 3.60%. Going forward, the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain in the spotlight, which is scheduled for Wednesday. AUD/USD technical outlook  AUD/USD has rebounded firmly after sensing strength near the upward-sloping trendline of the Symmetrical Triangle chart pattern, which is placed from March 10 low at 0.6564 on a two-hour scale.

"USD/JPY pays little heed to Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s defense of easy-money policies as the Yen pair renews its intraday low near 130.50 while reversing the week-start gains during early Tuesday day. In doing so, the quote traces the recently downbeat US Treasury bond yields and the US Dollar amid cautious optimism in the market. “It’s premature to debate an exit from easy monetary policy,” saidBoJGovernor Kuroda during one of the last attempts to defend ultra-easy monetary policy before leaving the desk in April. Also read:BoJ’s Kuroda: It’s premature to debate exit from easy monetary policy That said, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury yields grind lower around 3.51% and 3.92% by the press time, paring the week-start rebound after witnessing a three-week downtrend. That said,the US Dollar Index(DXY) drops for the second consecutive day to 102.65, down 0.21% intraday by the press time. While tracing the softer yields and US Dollar, the market’s optimism surrounding the banking sector and easing inflation seems to gain major attention. Behind the moves could be the US and European policymakers stretched emergency credit lines to the troubled banks and announced deposit insurance schemes. Recently adding strength to the risk-on mood were comments from the central bank officials pushing back the banking crisis concerns and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) deal. Earlier in the day, US Treasury Department said that the US will keep using tools to prevent banking contagion as needed.  Before that, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr showed readiness to tame the banking crisis while signaling ease in the inflation woes. It’s worth noting that the recently downbeat US data weighed on the hawkishFedbets, especially after talks of US recession, previously teased by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, which in turn exerted downside pressure on the USD/JPY prices. On Monday, the US Dallas Fed Manufacturing Business Index dropped to -15.7 in March versus -10.9 expected and -13.5 prior. On the flip side, the geopolitical fears surrounding China and Russia challenge the market’s upbeat sentiment, as well as the USD/JPY bears. That said, talks about China’s failure to keep the pace of growth promised, as well as Russia’s alleged readiness to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. On the same line are the latest comments from North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un who recently stated, per KCNA news, “(They) should be fully ready to use nuclear weapons at any time.” Recently, Russia was said to have test-fired an anti-ship missile in the Sea of Japan. Against this backdrop, Japan’s Nikkei 225 prints mild gains while tracing the S&P 500 Futures. Moving on, the US Conference Board’s (CB) Consumer Confidence for March, as well as the second-tier housing and activity data, can direct intraday moves of theUSD/JPY pair. However, major attention will be given to the US and Japan inflation clues, scheduled for release on Friday. Above all, the yields are crucial to aptly predict the Yen pair’s moves.

The Cable formed a higher low while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) formed a lower high, which indicated that the momentum oscillator got oversold in an uptrend and produced a bargain buy opportunity for the market participants. Upward-sloping 20-and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 1.2279 and 1.2260 respectively, indicate more upside ahead. The RSI (14) has scaled into the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which warrants more gains. Should the asset break above the horizontal resistance plotted from March 23 high at 1.2343, Pound Sterling bulls would drive Cable toward January 26 high at 1.2430. A break of the latter would expose the asset to a fresh nine-month high near the psychological resistance at 1.2500.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected GBP trade sideways between 1.2200 and 1.2300 yesterday. After dipping to a low of 1.2222, GBP rose to a high of 1.2294 in late NY trade. Upward momentum has improved, albeit not much. Today, GBP is likely to test the major resistance at 1.2340. A break of this level is not ruled out but GBP is unlikely to maintain a foothold above this level (next resistance is at 1.2400). Support is at 1.2265; a break of 1.2240 would indicate that GBP is not advancing further.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from yesterday (27 Mar, spot at 1.2240) is still valid.

"Australian Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures will be released on Wednesday, March 29 at 00:30 GMT and as we get closer to the release time, here are forecasts from economists and researchers of five major banks regarding the upcoming inflation data. Headline is expected at 7.1% year-on-year vs. 7.4% in January. If so, it would be the second straight month of deceleration but would remain well above the 2-3% target range. ANZ “Our expectation for the monthly CPI of a 6.8% yearly increase would imply a monthly outcome of 0.3%, which while solidly above the pre-2022 February averages would represent a step down from the February 2022 result. A monthly CPI result weaker than our expectation would present a challenge to our view that the RBA will tighten again in April.” ING “A further unwinding of the holiday-induced surge in travel and recreation prices in February, together with some lower food prices, will partly offset higher gasoline prices and some stickiness in other subcomponents to bring inflation in Australia back below 7% in February. If so, it will support the RBA’s recent hints thatratesare close to a peak, with one more 25 bps hike looking like the most likely outcome now, taking the cash rate target to 3.85%.” NAB “We expect the Monthly CPI Indicator to fall to 7.2% from 7.4% YoY, in line with consensus, but what the services subcomponents say about inflation trends will be as important as the headline given the limitations of the monthly indicator.” TDS “February CPI print will grab attention after the Bank flagged it as a key data point for its April decision. Our dovishforecast(7.0% YoY) is due to the large seasonal decline from recreational services, partly offset by firm price increase rises for education and transport. We still retain a 25 bps hike for the April meeting as inflation is still far above the RBA's inflation target.” SocGen “We expect monthly headline inflation to have fallen from 7.4% in January to 7.0% in February, which would support the argument that headline inflation peaked in December. Further evidence that inflation may have peaked could justify a pause (or termination) in the RBA tightening cycle, but solid proof can only be provided by the quarterly CPI data to be released next month.” ",1

It has since revised itseconomic outlookto the upside, but continues to expect a significant fall in inflation.” “As we see the risk that inflation might not ease as quickly and that the BoE might drop behind the curve with its monetary policy, we remain sceptical regarding Sterling and expect weaker GBP levels over the coming months.” ",0

Spot prices, however, manage to recover a few pips from the daily low and climb back to the 131.00 mark during the early European session. The prevalent risk-on environment - as depicted by a generally positive tone around the equity markets - undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and turns out to be a key factor lending some support to the USD/JPY pair. The takeover of Silicon Valley Bank by First Citizens Bank & Trust Company from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) helps calm market nerves about the contagion risk. Adding to this, regulators reassured that they stand ready to address anyliquidityshortfalls and further boosted investors' appetite for perceived riskier assets. That said, a combination of factors warrants some caution before placing aggressive bulls bets around the major, Expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will tweak its bond yield control policy and whittle down its massive stimulus under new Governor Kazuo Ueda could limit losses for the JPY. Apart from this, a modest US Dollar (USD) weakness might further contribute to keeping a lid on any meaningful upside for the USD/JPY pair.

Easing fears of a full-blown banking crisis continues to push the US Treasury bond yields higher, which, in turn, assist the buck to recover its modest intraday losses to a two-day low. That said, the Federal Reserve's signal last week that it might soon pause the rate-hiking cycle, along with a positive risk tone, could cap the upside for the safe-haven Greenback and lend support to the GBP/USD pair.

Adding to this, regulators have reassured that they stood ready to address anyliquidityshortfalls and further boosted investors' appetite for perceived riskier assets. The British Pound, on the other hand, could draw support from the overnight remarks by the Bank of Governor Andrew Bailey, saying that inflation remained the main driver of monetary policy decisions. During a speech at the London School of Economics, Bailey signalled that the central bank is ready to deliver more monetary tightening if signs of persistent inflationary pressures become more evident.

Furthermore, regulators reassured that they stood ready to address anyliquidityshortfalls helped reverse the recent negative sentiment and boosted investors' confidence. This, along with the fact that the Federal Reserve toned down its aggressive approach to reining in inflation, keeps the USD bulls on the defensive and acts as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair. It is worth recalling that the US central bank sounded cautious about the outlook and signalled last week that a pause to interest rate hikes was on the horizon. The Aussie further draws support from mostly in-line domestic data, which showed that Retail Sales grew 0.2% MoM in February and indicated some economic resilience. The aforementioned fundamental backdrop supports prospects for some meaningful appreciating move for the AUD/USD pair.

"The GBP/USD pairbuilds on the previous day's positive move and gains some follow-through traction for the second successive day on Tuesday.

Eyes on Aussie CPI Meanwhile and domestically, Australia's February Consumer Price Index print will grab attention after the Reserve Bank of Australia flagged it as a key data point for its April monetary policy decision, as analysts at TD Securities explained. ´´We expect CPI inflation to ease further to 7% YoY in February (cons: 7.2%) from 7.4% last month and further affirm the RBA's view that inflation likely peaked in Q4 last year. Our below consensusforecastis due to the large seasonal decline from recreational services (e.g., travel prices), partly offset by firm price increases for education and transport. We still retain a 25bps hike forecast for the April meeting as inflation is still far above the RBA's inflation target and central banks such asECBandFedhave pushed through with hikes despite recent financial volatility.´´ AUD/USD  ",1

"The EUR/USD pairhas stretched its north-side journey to near the critical resistance of 1.0850 in the early Asian session. The absence of exhaustion signals indicates that the major currency pair is gathering strength to add more gains. Improvedmarket sentimentafter easing United States banking jitters and rising expectations for a steady monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed) led to a solid rally in the shared currency pair. S&P500 futures remained choppy on Tuesday amid the absence of potential triggers, portraying a quiet market mood. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) corrected further to near 102.40 as the Fed would look to keepratesunchanged. Also, US inflation would remain under pressure due to tight credit conditions by US banks. The demand for US government bonds remained weak as the absence of bad news about US banking was considered goodnewsby the market participants. This led to a further rise in 10-year US Treasury yields to 3.57%. Upbeat US Consumer Confidence data failed to provide support to the USD Index. The sentiment data improved to 104.2 from the former release of 103.4. Theeconomic datarose after a three-month losing trend despite potential fears of a banking fiasco and higher rates by the Fed, which are denting households’ sentiment as they are struggling to offset the impact of inflated prices of goods and services. On theEurozonefront, the release of the German Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data will be of significant importance. As per the projections, the annual German HICP will soften firmly to 7.5% from the former release of 9.3%. An expected decline in German inflation would relieve some pressure from theEuropean Central Bank(ECB). EUR/USD  ",1
"USD/JPYpares some of Monday’s gains and drops below the 131.00 figure after Wall Street closed with losses. At the time of writing, the USD/JPY is trading at 130.91, registering minuscule gains as the Asian session begins. USD/JPY Price action The USD/JPY is neutral to downward biased, and Tuesday’s close below 131.00 could exacerbate a fall toward the last week’s lows of 129.64. For a bearish continuation, the USD/JPY needs to tumble below 130.49, which could open the door toward 130.00, ahead of 129.64. Contrarily, a bullish scenario is likely if the USD/JPY climbs toward 131.76. Hence. The USD/JPY first resistance would be 132.00, followed by 133.00. Once cleared, the 50-day EMA would be tested at 133.27, followed by the 200-day EMA at 133.81. Short term, the USD/JPY 4-hourchartis consolidating after Tuesday’s low of 130.40. additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shifted flat, in bearish territory, while the Rate of  Change (RoC) is almost unchanged. Therefore, the USD/JPY might continue to be range-bound before resuming upwards/downwards. If the USD/JPY breaks above the 20-EMA at 131.00, that will open the door for further upside. The next resistance would be the R1 daily pivot point at 131.44, followed by the 50-EMA at 131.67, ahead of challenging 132.00. On the other hand, the USD/JPY first support would be the S1 daily pivot at 130.29, followed by 130.00, ahead of testing the YTD low at 129.64.

The major has been underpinned as the market participants are not expecting bold decisions on interestratesfrom the Federal Reserve (Fed) ahead. S&P500 futures remained choppy on Tuesday despite the widening United States Goods Trade Deficit (Feb). Exports of goods witnessed a decline led by weak outgo of motor vehicles and parts along with consumer goods and capital goods, as reported by Reuters. Further imports of goods also slipped by 2.3%. TheUS Dollar index(DXY) corrected firmly to near 102.40 as investors anticipate continuous pressure on US Consumer Price Index (CPI) through tight credit conditions from US banks amid a turbulent environment, which is prone to further financial instability. Going forward, the release of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Q4) data will remain in focus. Thursday’s annualized GDP is expected to remain steady at 2.7%. Apart from that, quarterly core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) (Q4) might also remain anchored at 4.3%. On the United Kingdom front, the Pound Sterling remained solid asBank of England(BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey has remained doors open for further policy-tightening after hiking rates by 25 basis points (bps) last week to 4.25%. More rates would be welcomed by the BoE if there would be evidence of persistent inflation. Meanwhile, overall shop inflation in the UK economy has climbed to 8.9% from the prior release of 8.4%, the highest reading in 18 years as reported by the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Rising food inflation has been a major catalyst behind stubborn UK shop inflation.

At the time of writing,USD/JPYis trading at 131.04 and between the Asian range of 130.75 and 131.07. The yen is also higher as Japanese companies repatriate yen ahead of their fiscal-year end at the end of March. The yen is the best performer despite the Bank of Japan seen on hold for the foreseeable future and banking sector tensions easing.

"AUD/USD drops 20 pips to 0.6690 as Aussie inflation disappoints during early Wednesday. In doing so, the risk barometer pair snaps two-day winning streak. That said, Australia’s Monthly Consumer Price Index dropped to 6.8% YoY in February versus 7.1% expected and 7.4% prior. Given the latest slump in the inflation data, the odds of witnessing another 0.25% rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) become unwelcomed and drown the AUD/USD prices, especially after the downbeat AussieRetail Sales. Also read:Aussie CPI misses expectationsa and AUD drops below 0.6700 Contrary to the downbeat data, a firmer risk profile puts a floor under the AUD/USD pair even if it drops by the press time. While tracing the key catalysts for the latest risk-on mood, receding fears of a banking crisis and hopes of less aggressive rate hikes from the top-tier central banks seem to gain the market’s attention. Also keeping the traders positive are chatters that the likely recession in some of the developed countries will be less severe than initially expected. On the contrary,newsthat Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers will convene a meeting of the country's top financial regulators to check how the latest volatility in global financial markets could affect the country, an official in the treasurer's office said on Tuesday per Reuters, prod the optimism. On the same line could be the much-debated $5.4 million Credit Default Swap (CDS) trade of Deutsche Bank. Furthermore, financial market regulators from the US and Europe also showed their dislike for the market’s curbs and raised fears of late. Amid these plays, US Treasury bond yields struggle to extend the two-day rebound but S&P 500 Futures print mild gains at the latest. Having witnessed the initial reaction to Australia’s inflation data, AUD/USD pair traders should pay attention to the second-tier housing numbers for fresh impetus. However, more important will be the headlines surrounding the global banking sector's health and easing fears of more rate hikes by the top-tier central banks. Technical analysis The AUD/USD pair’s first daily closing beyond the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), around the 0.6700 by the press time, directs buyers towards the convergence of the 50-day EMA and the previous weekly high surrounding 0.6755-60.

"GBP/USD extends pullback from an eight-week high while printing mild losses near 1.2330 during early Wednesday. In doing so, the Cable pair prints the first daily loss in three. Given the nearly overbought RSI (14), coupled with the bearish Dojicandlestickat the multi-day top, the GBP/USD pair is likely to decline further. However, an upward-sloping support line from the last Friday, around 1.2300 by the press time, restricts the short-term downside of the Cable pair. Following that, the 50-SMA and the March 24 bottom, respectively near 1.2250 and 1.2190, could challenge the GBP/USD bears. It’s worth noting that the 100-SMA level surrounding 1.2135 acts as the last defense of the GBP/USD buyers, a break of which won’t hesitate to prod the mid-month low of near the 1.2000 psychological magnet. On the flip side, a convergence of the previous support line from March 08 and a fortnight-long ascending trend line, around 1.2390, challenges the GBP/USD buyers. Even if the quote rises past 1.2390, multiple tops marked during late 2022 and early 2023, around 1.2445-50, appear a tough nut to crack forthe Cablepair buyers.

Also testing the upside momentum are the overbought conditions of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) line, placed at 14. That said, USD/JPY rallied nearly 85 pips on breaking a fortnight-long descending trend line. The recovery moves, however, failed to cross the 200-Hour Moving Average (HMA). It’s worth noting that the MACD signals are bullish and can join the latest trend line breakout to propel Yen prices beyond the latest HMA hurdle surrounding 131.55. Even so, a downward-sloping resistance line from March 08, close to 131.90 by the press time, closely followed by the 132.00 round figure, could challenge the USD/JPY bulls. On the contrary, pullback moves remain elusive unless staying beyond the previous resistance line, around 131.05 at the latest. Following that, an ascending trend line from the last Friday, close to 130.60, will precede the latest swing low around 129.65 to act as the last defence of the USD/JPY bulls.

"EUR/USD witnesses headwinds at the weekly top as Euro traders remain cautious ahead of the key German clues. Adding strength to the pullback moves could be firmer yields and a rebound in US Dollar amid mixed sentiment. That said, the Euro pair eases to 1.0835, printing mild losses during early Wednesday, as it snaps a two-day winning streak. US Dollar Index(DXY) picks up bids to 102.60 while printing the first daily gains in three. In doing so, the greenback’s gauge versus the six major currencies traces upbeat US Treasury bond yields amid mixed US data and the market’s indecision. It’s worth noting that the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) deal and policymakers’ efforts to defend their respective banking system, not to forget the central banks’ confirmations that the financial crisis is off the table, keep the market cautiously optimistic. However, the latest geopolitical fears emanating from China, mainly due to the US blacklisting some more Chinese companies, join the upbeat US inflation expectations to weigh on the EUR/USD price. On the same line was thenewsthat French authorities raided five banks on tax avoidance and money laundering concerns, as well as the talks surrounding the $5.4 million Credit Default Swap (CDS) trade of Deutsche Bank. Talking about the data, US Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence rose to 104.2 in March, versus 101.0 expected and an upwardly revised prior figure of 103.4. Further, US Housing Price Index rose 0.2% MoM in January versus -0.6% expected and -0.1% prior while the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices matched 2.5% YoY forecasts for the said month compared to 4.5% previous readings. Against this backdrop, US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields print a three-day uptrend around 3.58% and 4.10% respectively while the S&P 500 Futures print mild gains, the first in three. Looking ahead, EUR/USD may witness further pullback amid fresh challenges to sentiment and upbeat US inflation expectations, per the 10-year and 5-year breakeven inflationratesfrom the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED). However, theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) officials have been more hawkish than their Federal Reserve (Fed) counterparts and hence firmer prints of inflation data can allow the EUR/USD buyers to return to the table. On Tuesday, ECB policymaker Madis Muller said that “although inflation is decreasing, it is still too soon to declare success.” On the same line were comments from Andrea Enria, Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), who said on Tuesday that direct exposure to Credit Suisse is relevant but manageable. Moving on, Germany’s GfK Consumer Confidence Survey for April will be crucial for providing initial signals for Thursday’s inflation numbers. Following that, second-tier statistics from the US will be important to watch for clear directions.

"The AUD/USD pair is displaying topsy-turvy moves below the round-level resistance of 0.6700 in the Asian session. The Aussie asset has turned rangebound after a vertical downside move post-softening of the Australian Consumer Price Index (CPI). Monthly Australian inflation (Fed) softened further to 6.9% from the prior release of 7.4% as households’ spending has trimmed dramatically. Households are struggling in bearing the burden of inflated goods and services with their nominal growth in earnings. This has bolstered the intention of pausing the policy-tightening spell by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) from its April meeting. Meanwhile, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) has shown a firmer recovery from 102.40. The recovery move by the USD Index has escalated to 102.60. On a two-hour scale, AUD/USD has shown a decent upside after sensing strength near the upward-sloping trendline of the Symmetrical Triangle chart pattern, which is placed from March 10 low at 0.6564. The downward-sloping trendline of thechartpattern is plotted from March 01 high at 0.6784. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6686 is acting as a cushion for the Australian Dollar. In addition to that, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is making efforts in keeping itself in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which will keep the Australian Dollar in the grip of bulls. Should the asset breaks above March 13 high at 0.6717, Aussie bulls would drive the asset further toward March 07 high at 0.67478 followed by the horizontal resistance plotted from February 23 low at 0.6781. On the contrary, a slippage below March 15 low at 0.6564 will drag the asset toward October 4 high at 0.6547 and the round-level support at 0.6500. AUD/USD two-hour chart  AUD/USD  ",0

Today, EUR could rise above 1.0870 but the chances of it staying above this level are not high. The next resistance is at 1.0900.

While there is no change in our view, short-term upward momentum is building, albeit tentatively. Looking ahead, EUR has to break and stay above 1.0900 before a sustained advance is likely.

The asset is expected to extend its upside journey towards 132.00 amid renewed fears of the continuation of ultra-loose monetary policy by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). For the past few months, the Japanese Yen was attracting bullish bets on hopes that the BoJ will exit from its decade-long expansionary policy after the arrival of novel BoJ leadership. However, an absence of hawkish commentary fromBoJGovernor Kazuo Ueda after holding the highest chair in the central bank has faded expectations of a shift in the policy stance. Meanwhile, ultra-dovish commentary from ex-BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has added fuel to fire. Ex-BoJ Kuroda cited “It is premature to debate an exit from easy monetary policy.” And, “More time is needed to stably and sustainably hit the price target.” The requirement of a dovish policy looks likely as the sustained inflation target has not been met yet.

In order for GBP to advance in a sustained manner, it has to break and stay above 1.2400. The likelihood of a clear break of 1.2400 is not high for now but it will remain intact as long as GBP stays above 1.2240 in the next few days.

"The AUD/USD pair struggles to capitalize on the previous day's positive move and comes under some renewed selling pressure on Wednesday. The steady intraday descent extends through the early European session and drags spot prices to a fresh daily low, around the 0.6675-0.6670 region in the last hour. The Australian Dollar weakens in reaction to the softer-than-expected domestic consumer inflation figures for February, which reaffirms bets that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will refrain from raising interestratesat its April meeting. In fact, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the headline CPI decelerated from the previous month’s reading of 7.4% to the 6.8% yearly rate, or an eight-month low in February. Apart from this, the emergence of someUS Dollar(USD) buying is seen exerting downward pressure on the AUD/USD pair. The recent rally in the US Treasury bond yields, bolstered by easing fears of a full-blown banking crisis, assists the USD to snap a two-day losing streak. That said, the Federal Reserve's less hawkish stance, along with the prevalent risk-on environment, could cap gains for the safe-haven buck and lend support to the AUD/USD pair. It is worth recalling that the Fed last week signalled that a pause to interest rate hikes was on the horizon. Furthermore, the takeover of Silicon Valley Bank by First Citizens Bank & Trust Company helped calm market nerves about the contagion risk. The aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before placing aggressive bearish bets around the AUD/USD pair and positioning for any further depreciating move. Traders now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of Pending Home Sales. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, might influence the USD and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair. The focus, however, will remain on the final US Q4 GDP on Thursday and the Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - on Friday. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0
"Extra decline looks likely inUSD/JPYwhile below the 132.00 mark, according to Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that USD ‘is likely to edge lower to 130.60, possibly testing the support at 130.20’. While USD weakened as expected, it did not test the support at 130.20 (low of 130.39). Downward momentum has waned with the rebound and USD is unlikely to weaken further. Today, USD is more likely to trade in a range, expected to be between 130.70 and 131.75.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have expected USD to weaken since the middle of last week. After USD dropped to 129.67 and rebounded strongly, in our latest update from Monday (27 Mar, spot at 130.70), we indicated “Further USD weakness is not ruled out but USD has to break and stay below 129.60 before further decline is likely”. Since then, USD has not been able to make much headway on the downside. Downward momentum is waning rapidly and the risk of USD bottoming is increasing. However, only a break of 132.00 (no change in ‘strong resistance’ from yesterday) would indicate that USD is not declining further.”",0

EUR/USD looks offered as dollar rebounds EUR/USD loses some momentum following an auspicious first half of the week and comes under some selling pressure on the back of the bounce in the greenback and the broad-based offered stance in the risk complex. Indeed, bulls appear to struggle to overcome the mid-1.0800s, while the better tone in the dollar remains underpinned by the mixed performance in US yields andsafe havendemand stemming from banking concerns. Meanwhile, ECB Board member Kazimir suggested that the core inflation could take a key role when it comes to interest rate decisions at the time when he left the door open to further rate hikes, albeit at a slower pace.

"The GBP/USD pair comes under some selling pressure on Wednesday, snapping a two-day winning streak and eroding a part of the overnight gains to its highest level since early February. The pair drops to a fresh daily low during the first half of the European session, albeit finds some support near the 1.2300 mark and recovers a few pips in the last hour. Following a two-day downtrend, theUS Dollar(USD) regains positive traction and turns out to be a key factor that exerts some downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. The takeover of Silicon Valley Bank by First Citizens Bank & Trust Company calmed market nerves about the contagion risk and eased fears of a full-blown banking crisis. This, in turn, led to a strong recovery in the US Treasury bond yields since the beginning of the current week, which, in turn, helps revive the USD demand. That said, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) less hawkish stance, signalling that a pause to interest rate hikes was on the horizon, acts as a headwind for the US bond yields. Apart from this, the prevalent risk-on mood - as depicted by a generally positive tone around the equity markets - might hold back traders from placing aggressive bets around the safe-haven buck. This, along with rising bets for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE), could lend some support to theGBP/USDpair. In fact, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said earlier this week that interestratesmay have to move higher if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressure. The bets were lifted further after the British Retail Consortium (BRC) reported that UK shop prices increased from 8.4% previously to 8.9% in the year to March - the highest reading on record since the survey started in 2005. Furthermore, food prices increased 15.0% over the year, also a record high, and could benefit the British Pound. This, in turn, suggests that the path of least resistance for the GB/USD pair is to the upside and any subsequent pullback might still be seen as a buying opportunity. There isn't any relevant macro data due for release on Wednesday from the UK, while the US economic docket features Pending Home Sales later during the early North American session.

That is why the Dollar has a more difficult standing against the Euro, as theFedhas become a little more cautious whereas theECBhas continued its rate cycle almost unaffected by the events of the past weeks and continues to sound restrictive. As a result, levels in EUR/USD above 1.08 seem justified.” “Monetary policy remains the most important driver. That is why in my view focus will remain on the price data.

Without further banking sector turmoil, data flow will dictate the sustainability of that degree of divergence in policy expectations and based on the consumer confidence data there is a greater risk of that divergence closing which could see EUR/USD again run out of steam as we move toward the 1.1000 level.” ",0
"The USD/JPY pair regains positive traction following the previous day's downfall and maintains its bid tone through the mid-European session on Wednesday. The momentum pushes spot prices to a one-week high, though bulls struggle to capitalize on the move further beyond the 132.00 round-figure mark, where the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) acts as a cap. Easing fears of a full-blown banking crisis remain supportive of a generally positive tone around the equity markets, which, in turn, undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. The takeover of Silicon Valley Bank by First Citizens Bank & Trust Company calmed market nerves about the contagion risk. This, coupled with the lack of negativenewsfrom the banking sector over the past two weeks, further boosted investors' confidence and helps reverse the recent negative sentiment. The JPY is further weighed down by the overnight dovish-sounding remarks by Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, saying that it is too early to debate an exit from easy monetary policy. Adding to this, the recent widening of the US-Japan rate differential, led by a rally in the US Treasury bond yields witnessed since the beginning of the current week, also contributes to driving flows away from the JPY. That said, subduedUS Dollar(USD) demand holds back traders from placing fresh bullish bets around the USD/JPY pair. The Federal Reserve (Fed) last week toned down its approach to reining in inflation and signalled that a pause to interest rate hikes was on the horizon in the wake of the turmoil in the banking sector. This leads to a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields and could act as a headwind for the USD. TheBoJ, on the other hand, is expected to tweak its bond yield control policy and whittle down its massive stimulus under new Governor Kazuo Ueda. This further contributes to keeping a lid on the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. Market participants now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of Pending Home Sales later during the early North American session. Apart from this, the US bond yields will influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to theUSD/JPYpair.

TheUS Dollar(USD) gains some positive traction amid a further rise in the US Treasury bond yields and is seen as a key factor acting as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. Hopes that a full-blown banking crisis can be averted might have been averted fuel speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) might stick to its policy tightening path, which, in turn, continue to push the US bond yields higher. That said, the prevalent risk-on mood - as depicted by a generally positive tone around the equity markets - might hold back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the safe-haven Greenback. In the absence of negativenewsfrom the banking sector over the past two weeks, the takeover of Silicon Valley Bank by First Citizens Bank & Trust Company calmed market nerves about the contagion risk. US regulators reiterated strength in the banking system and helped reverse the recent negative sentiment in the markets. Furthermore, theBank of England(BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday that the UK banking system is in a strong position and is not experiencing stress linked to the global turmoil in the banking sector. Apart from this, bets for additional rate hikes by the BoE continue to act as a tailwind for the British Pound.

The pair maintains its offered tone through the early North American session and is currently placed near the lower end of its daily range, around the 0.6670-0.6660 region. The Australian Dollar started losing ground in reaction to the softer-than-expected domestic consumer inflation figures, which fuels speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could pause its rate-hiking cycle at the April meeting. In fact, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that the headline CPI decelerated from the previous month's reading of 7.4% to 6.8% in the year to February, marking the slowest rise since June 2022. This, along with a modest pickup in theUS Dollar(USD) demand, is seen exerting some downward pressure on the AUD/USD pair.

Apart from this, the prevalent risk-on mood – as depicted by a strong opening rally around the US equity markets – could cap gains for the safe-haven buck and lend some support to the risk-sensitive Aussie. This, in turn, makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before positioning for any further depreciating move for the AUD/USD pair.

That said, the Aussie pair’s previous losses could be linked to the US Dollar’s rebound and downbeat Australian inflation numbers while the latest inaction is likely due to a lack of a major catalyst, as well as mixed concerns about inflation and banking. On Wednesday, Australia’s Monthly Consumer Price Index dropped to 6.8% YoY in February versus 7.2% expected and 7.4% prior. The reading followed downbeatRetail Salesand triggered a fall in the odds of witnessing another 0.25% rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). On the other hand, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) marked the first daily gain in three even as themarket sentimentimproved and the US Treasury bond yields. The reason might be the month-end positioning, as well as the hawkishFedcomments, not to forget the recent fears emanating from China. Also likely to have favored the US Dollar could be the increase in the US inflation expectations, per the 10-year and 5-year breakeven inflation rates from the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED). The US blacklisting of Chinese companies and Beijing’s dislike of a meeting between the White House Speak and the Taiwan President can be considered the key catalysts to challenge the previously firmer sentiment and allow the US Dollar to snap a two-day downtrend. Elsewhere, Bloomberg came out with thenewssuggesting Fed Chair Jerome Powell showed forecasts for one more rate hike in 2023, which in turn pushed back talks of policy pivot and favor the US Dollar bulls. Though, Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said, “We will be looking at incoming data, financial conditions to make a meeting-by-meeting judgment onrates. At home, Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers teased a shift in the RBA’s review proposals surrounding inflation while saying, “Some recommendations from an independent review of the RBA monetary policy decision-making and board make-up may require legislative changes to enact.” Amid these plays, Wall Street closed with notable gains led by tech and bankstockswhile the US Treasury bond yields eased. Given the light calendar in the Asia-Pacific region, the AUD/USD pair may rely on the risk catalysts for clear directions. Among them, the inflation and banking headlines will be the key to follow. Technical analysis AUD/USD pair gradually recovers towards the 50-DMA hurdle of 0.6830, backed by the latest breakout of the 21-DMA, close to 0.6665 by the press time.

"“Underlying inflation in the eurozone is proving sticky and the recent fall in energy costs may not pull it down as fast as some expect,European Central Bank(ECB) policymaker Isabel Schnabel said on Wednesday, highlighting the bank's chief concern,” reported Reuters late Wednesday. Schnabel, head of the ECB's market operations, also added that last year's energy price spike seeped into the broader economy quickly but the reversal may take longer. It’s worth noting that ECB’s Schnabel spoke at a National Association for Business Economics conference in Washington. More comments My suspicion is that it is not the case,  that it may not drop out as quickly as it moves in. And it's not even clear whether it's going to be completely symmetric in the sense that everything is even going to drop out at all. ECB has some flexibility in reaching its 2% target and did not want to create needless pain by acting too quickly. Our target is defined over the medium term, and so of course, we do not want to cause unnecessary pain.

"The Euro (EUR) advanced for three straight sessions against the US Dollar (USD), but late in the North American session, the EUR/USD retreated, forming a doji. Hence, indecision is the game's name, as the greenback staged a recovery on Wednesday. The EUR/USD is trading at 1.0841, down 0.02%, as the Asian session begins. German and US inflation figures, eyed by EUR/USD traders The shared currency has been bolstered by a soft US Dollar, which snapped two days of straight losses, as shown by a basket of six currencies vs. the buck. TheUS Dollar Indexrose 0.22%, at 102.654 on Wednesday. The US economic docket featured Pending Home Sales, which increased by 0.8% MoM in February, exceeding expectations for a 0.3% drop. Annually, it fell by 21.1%, less than the 29.4% drop predicted. On theEurozone(EU) side, the German Gfk Consumer sentiment in April improved to -29.5 from a revised -30.6 in March. Although it improved, it was beneath the estimates of -29.0. In the meantime,European Central Bank(ECB) policymakers have stressed the need for higher interest rates after the bank turmoil dissipated. Philip Lane, the ECB Chief Economist, said, “Under our baseline scenario, to make sure inflation comes down to 2%, more hikes will be needed.” Therefore, the EUR/USD pair has been upward pressured as market participants estimate that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) would leaveratesunchanged at 4.75%-5.00%. After that, a few rate cuts have been priced in by the year’s end. The EUR/USD would be influenced by inflation data in the US and the EU on Thursday and Friday. The Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation, the core PCE, will be revealed on Friday. Any upward revisions could put into play further rate increases by the US central bank. On the EU’s front, rising inflation in Germany would cement the case for another interest rate increase by the ECB. What to watch? On Thursday, the EU’s calendar will feature German inflation figures. In the US, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Q4, alongside Initial Jobless Claims for the last week, will be released. EUR/USD Technical analysis  Given the backdrop, the EUR/USD triple bottom remains in play. A fall below the March 15 daily high at 1.0759 would invalidate thechartpattern and exacerbate a fall. That would expose the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.0744, followed by the 50-day EMA, shy of 1.0700, at 1.0696. On the flip side, a break above 1.0900 andthe EUR/USD pairwill test the week’s high at 1.0929 before challenging 1.1000. EUR/USD  ",1
"GBP/USD stays defensive above 1.2300 amid early Thursday’s Asian session, making rounds to a 15-pip trading range in the last, as bears struggle to keep the reins afterthe Cablepair reversed from a two-month high the previous day. That said, the Cable pair took a U-turn from a multi-day top the previous day after an upward-sloping resistance line from late February challenged the bulls. However, the bullish MACD signals and an absence of the overbought RSI (14) seem to have tamed the bearish bias. Adding strength to the upside bias is the pair’s ability to trade beyond the two-week-old upward-sloping support line and the key moving averages. With this, the GBP/USD buyers are likely to again challenge the aforementioned resistance line, around 1.2370 by the press time. In that case, a horizontal area comprising multiple tops marked since mid-December 2022, around 1.2445-50, gains major attention. However, likely overbought conditions of the RSI around then could challenge the Cable bulls afterward, if not then the GBP/USD price won’t hesitate to challenge the May 2022 high of around 1.2670. On the flip side, a two-week-long ascending support line, close to 1.2290 by the press time, restricts the immediate downside of the pair, a break of which highlights the 10-DMA support of 1.2270. It should be noted, however, that a clear downside break of the 10-DMA can direct GBP/USD towards the 50-DMA, close to 1.2150 by the press time.

"TheUSD/JPYpair is facing barricades in reclaiming the immediate resistance of 133.00 in the Asian session. The major is expected to resume its upside journey as global banking fears have eased, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) has shown a decent recovery, and fears of softening of Japan’s inflation have renewed. Easing US banking jitters after the announcement of the acquisition of collapsed Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) deposits and loans to efforts made by US authorities to infuse confidence among investors have trimmed appeal for the Japanese Yen as a safe-haven. Investors were gung ho for the Japanese Yen when the US administration alarmed shakedown in the banking sector. However, the market participants believe that the US banking sector has already reported its collateral damage, which has forced them to withdraw funds from the Japanese Yen. This also helped the USD Index in building a cushion around 102.40. A recovery move by the USD Index has already pushed it to above 102.60. The US Dollar is expected to remain in action ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred inflation tool, core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index (Feb) data. According to the estimates, monthly core PCE inflation would accelerate by 0.4%, lower than the former expansion of 0.6%. The annual figure is expected to remain steady at 4.7%. On the Tokyo front, investors are focusing on Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which will release on Friday. The street is anticipating further softening of the headline Tokyo CPI to 2.7% from the former release of 3.4% led by declining oil prices in the international market. However, the core CPI that strips off oil and food prices is seen expanding to 3.3% from the former release of 3.2%. More stimulus measures are expected from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) in keeping inflation steadily above desired levels. USD/JPY  ",1

"The AUD/USD pair is showing topsy-turvy action in a narrow range around 0.6680 in the Asian session. The Aussie asset remained in action on Wednesday after the monthly Australian Consumer Price Index (CPI) softens further to 6.8% from the former release of 7.4% and its peak of 8.4% recorded in December. A consecutive deceleration in Australian inflation has strengthened hopes for a pause in the rate-hiking spell by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). However, economists at ANZ Bank are of the view that “While the RBA has signaled its intention to pause at some point in coming months, we continue to think that the data is not yet consistent with a pause.” Meanwhile, S&P500 futures are showing nominal losses after a super bullish Wednesday, portraying mild pessimism in the overall positive market mood. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is looking to resume its upside move after sensing a cushion around 102.60. On an hourly scale, AUD/USD is forming a Head and Shoulder chart pattern, which indicates a prolonged consolidation. A breakdown of the aforementioned chart pattern results in a bearish reversal. The neckline of thechartpattern is plotted from March 29 low at 0.6661. The asset has dropped below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6682, which indicates that the short-term trend has turned bearish. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the 40.00-60.00 range. A break into the bearish range of 20.00-40.00 will trigger the downside momentum. A slippage below March 29 low at 0.6661 will drag the asset toward March 24 low at 0.6625 and the March 15 low at 0.6564. Should the asset breaks above March 13 high at 0.6717, Aussie bulls would drive the asset further toward March 07 high at 0.67478 followed by the horizontal resistance plotted from February 23 low at 0.6781.

"GBP/USD renews intraday low near 1.2295 as it stretches the previous day’s U-turn from the highest levels since early February.The Cablepair’s latest pullback could be linked to the chatters suggesting hardships for theBank of England(BoE) hawks, as well as the US Dollar’s sustained rebound, amid a sluggish Asian session on Thursday. Reuters quotes the UK’s 13.1% jump in car production during February to mark the easing in the supply-chain woes, which in turn challenges the Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey’s previously hawkish statements. Additionally, BOE policymaker Catherine Mann flagged challenges for the UK’s central bank to do its job in the second half of the year, suggesting more hurdles for the hawks moving forward. It should be noted that UK Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt’s comments saying, “Core inflation will be harder to bring down,” joined the BoE Governor Bailey’s readiness for more rate hikes, if needed, to put a floor under the Cable price. On the other hand, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) marked the first daily gain in three the previous day, up 0.09% intraday near 102.75 by the press time. A retreat in the US Treasury bond yields joined the quarter-end positioning and cautious optimism in the market to underpin the US Dollar’s latest rebound. Adding strength to the greenback’s rebound could be the geopolitical fears emanating from China, Russia and North Korea. However, an absence of hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve (Fed) officials joins the absence of talks about banking woes to weigh on the US Dollar. That said, Bloomberg came out with thenewssuggestingFedChair Jerome Powell showed forecasts for one more rate hike in 2023, which in turn pushed back talks of policy pivot and favor the US Dollar bulls. Though, Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said, “We will be looking at incoming data and financial conditions to make a meeting-by-meeting judgment onrates.” Elsewhere, optimism surrounding the technology and banking sector allows the GBP/USD to fight back the bears. Against this backdrop, US 10-year and two-year Treasury yields marked their first daily loss in three on Wednesday by ending the North American trading session around 3.57% and 4.10% respectively, making rounds to the same level by the press time. It should be observed that the S&P 500 Futures struggle to extend Wall Street’s gains at the latest. Moving on, a light calendar in the UK suggests the GBP/USD pair traders watch for risk catalysts and the US factors for clear directions. As a result, the final readings of the US fourth quarter (Q4) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will join the Q4 Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) details and the weekly jobless claims will be important to track.

"AUD/USD fades bounce off intraday low even as Chinese Premier tries to lure the bulls during early Thursday. The reason could be linked to the fresh Sino-American tension over Taiwan and the recently dovish concerns about the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) next moves. That said, the Aussie pair drops to 0.6670 during the two-day downtrend by the press time. China's Premier Li Qiang recently said that the economic situation in March is even better than in January and February. The policymaker, however, also raised geopolitical tension by opposing trade protectionism and decoupling, which indirectly targets the US. Elsewhere, the National Australia Bank (NAB) cut itsforecastfor the RBA peak rate to 3.85% from 4.15% after witnessing the recent fall in inflation andRetail Salesfigures.  The NAB also expects a 0.25% rate hike in April. It should be noted that Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) all of them expect a pause in the RBA’s rate hike trajectory after April’s 25 basis points (bps) of a lift in the benchmarkrates. It should be noted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s teasing of one more rate hike joined Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr’s emphasis on data dependency to allow theUS Dollarto remain firmer. On the same line could be Fed Chair Powell’s push for alteration in deposit insurance. As a result, theFedhawks do flex their muscles but wait for more clues and amplify the market’s anxiety ahead of Friday’s key inflation gauge from the US, namely the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index. Amid these plays, the S&P 500 Futures struggle around a one-week high marked the previous day, while ignoring Wall Street’s upbeat performance, whereas the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields grind higher after teasing the bond buyers the previous day. It’s worth mentioning that Australia’s Job Vacancies improved in February, to -1.5% QoQ versus -4.9% prior while the US Pending Home Sales grew 0.8% MoM during the said month versus -3.0% expected and 8.1% prior.

"USD/JPY prints mild losses around 132.60 heading into Thursday’s European session. In doing so, the Yen pair struggles to respect the upbeatUS Dollarand Treasury bond yields amid mixed concerns about the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) next move. Also weighing on the major currency pair are the talks of Japanese credit rating and the Federal Reserve (Fed) officials’ cautious optimism. It should be noted, however, that the geopolitical fears surrounding Russia, North Korea and China weigh on the market’s sentiment and allow the Yen to cheer its traditional haven status after rising heavily the previous day. BoJpolicymakers, including the outgoing Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, advocate for an easy money policy but the latest wage accord and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s readiness for higher wages can challenge the ultra-loose policies. Recently, global rating agency Fitch Ratings affirmed Japan’s sovereign credit rating at ‘A’ while maintaining a ‘stable’ outlook. “Base case remains that BoJ will maintain its loose monetary policy over the medium term,” said Fitch. Elsewhere, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s teasing of one more rate hike joined Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr’s emphasis on data dependency to test the market’s previous optimism.

As a result, theFedhawks do flex their muscles but wait for more clues and amplify the market’s anxiety ahead of Friday’s key inflation gauge from the US, namely the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index. It should be observed that China Premier Li Qiang’s dislike for trade protectionism and decoupling, which indirectly targets the US, joined the North Korean and Russian tactics over nuclear power to sour the sentiment. On a different page, the majority of the central bankers defend their previous bias about inflation and hence propel yields amid economic fears. Furthermore, International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, “Urgently need faster, more efficient mechanisms for providing debt support to vulnerable countries.” Her comments renew banking fears which eased previously. Amid these plays, the S&P 500 Futures struggled around a one-week high marked the previous day, while ignoring Wall Street’s upbeat performance, whereas the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields grind higher after teasing the bond buyers the previous day. Moving forward, the US fourth quarter (Q4) Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) and final prints of the Q4 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can entertain Yen pair traders.

USD Index loses momentum despite easing dovish Federal Reserve bets The USD Index has shown a decent correction after failing to extend its upside journey to the critical resistance of 103.00. It looks like the USD Index has failed to capitalize on easing dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) bets after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell anticipated one more rate hike in 2023. As per the CME Fedwatch tool, chances of an unchanged monetary policy in May have trimmed quickly to 50%. In March’s monetary policy meeting, Federal Reserve Powell also stated that one more rate hike is still needed after pushingratesto 4.75-5.00%.

Fears of US banking crisis receded further US authorities have put their blood and sweat into restoring the confidence of investors in the troubled banking system after the collapse of three mid-size banks. The administration is not considering an expansion of blanket insurance for all deposits but has come forward with more measures. Bloomberg reported that the private meeting between Federal Reserve Powell and US lawmakers has also discussed the agenda of raising insurance limits for deposits after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. Currently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) currently insures up to $250,000 per depositor.

ECB policymaker Peter Kazimir cited on Wednesday “I think inflation is too high for too long.” He further added that the European Central Bank will consider the financial situation before arriving at the interest rate decision. ECB Kazimir believes “There is a genuine danger that banks will cut back on lending.” About interest rate guidance, ECB Kazimir is of the view, “We should continue in raising rates, possibly at a slower pace.” It seems that German HICP data will deliver more clarity about the monetary policyoutlook. The street is anticipating monthly German HICP to expand by 0.8% vs. the former release of 1.0%. On an annual basis, German HICP would soften dramatically to 7.5% from the prior release of 9.3%.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that ‘Despite the advance, there is no significant improvement in upward momentum’. We added, ‘However, there is room for GBP to rise to 1.2370 before the risk of a pullback increases’. GBP rose to a high of 1.2362 in London trade before pulling back to end the day at 1.2314 (-0.22%). The underlying tone has softened somewhat but while GBP is likely to edge lower, any decline is viewed as part of a 1.2270/1.2340 range. In other words, a clear break below 1.2270 is unlikely.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from yesterday (29 Mar, spot at 1.2330) is still valid. As highlighted, upward momentum appears to be building, albeit tentatively. In order for GBP to advance in a sustained manner, it has to break and stay above 1.2400. The likelihood of a clear break of 1.2400 is not high for now but it will remain intact as long as GBP stays above 1.2240 in the next 1-2 days.

"Eurostat will release the preliminary estimate ofEurozoneHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for March on Friday, March 31 at 09:00 GMT and as we get closer to the release time, here are the expectations forecast by the economists and researchers of seven major banks regarding the upcoming EU inflation print. The flash estimate for Eurozone is likely to decelerate to 7.2% YoY in March vs. 8.5% in February while the annualized Core HICP is seen a tad higher at 5.7% vs. 5.6% in February. Commerzbank “In the euro area, the inflation rate is likely to have fallen from 8.5% in February to 6.8% in March. This is because the massive rise in energy prices in March 2022 is now excluded from the year-on-year comparison. However, from the ECB's perspective, it is likely to be more important that the core inflation rate probably remains at 5.6%. This would show that underlying inflation remains high.” Danske Bank “Despite a further decline in headline inflation to 7.9%, we expect Euro area HICP figures for March to show still a picture of strong underlying inflation pressures, with core inflation remaining unchanged at 5.6%.” Deutsche Bank “We see March headline at 7.1% (+1.1% MoM) and core at 5.8% (+1.4% MoM). As a reminder, the latest 5.6% core inflation reading is the highest on record. We don't expect it to peak until the 6.0% they expect in July.” Citi “We see headline HICP falling to 6.8% on energy base effects but core CPI still accelerating to 5.7%.” TDS “Headline inflation is set to plunge across the EZ to 7.3 YoY as the spike in energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine drops out of the YoY calculation. Some reversal of Feb's weather-related jump in fresh food prices also adds some downside pressure. Focus will be on the core measure, though, and another strong print  (our forecast is 5.8%) will maintain pressure on the ECB to hikeratesfurther.” SocGen “Negative energy base effects should lead to a massive deceleration in headline inflation from 8.4% to 6.7% in March. However, given the recent upside surprise, especially in food inflation, we believe there is upside risk to thisforecast. Furthermore, the strength in core inflation should continue. We anticipate an increase from 5.6% to 5.7%, again, with the risks tilted to the upside.” Credit Suisse “We expect headline inflation to fall from 8.7% to 8.5% YoY and core inflation to rise from 5.6% to a new all-time high of 5.8% YoY in March.” ",0
"EUR/CHF holds onto the previous day’s bearish bias while refreshing intraday low near 0.9945 during early Thursday morning in Europe. On Tuesday, the cross-currency pair marked the heaviest daily gains in 11 weeks but failed to surpass a downward-sloping resistance line from March 02. Not only the failure to cross the key resistance line but the overbought RSI (14) and the impending bear cross on the MACD also lures the EUR/CHF pair sellers during the second consecutive loss-making day. It’s worth noting, however, that the 100-bar and 200-bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA) joins a two-week-long ascending trend line to highlight the 0.9915-10 area as the key challenge for the EUR/CHF bears to tackle to keep the reins. Following that, the 0.9900 round and multiple levels around 0.9850 can offer intermediate halts during the pair’s fall targeting the monthly low of around 0.9705. On the flip side, a clear break of the aforementioned resistance line, close to 0.9985 at the latest, isn’t an open invitation to the EUR/CHF bulls as a downward-sloping trend line from January 12, near 1.0020, acts as an extra filter towards the north. Should the EUR/CHF price manage to cross the 1.0020 hurdle, the odds of witnessing a rally towards the yearly top of around 1.0100 can’t be ruled out.

"According to the latest data published by the Instituto Nacional de Estadístic (INE) on Thursday, inflation in Spain decelerated to 3.1% year-on-year (YoY) in March, compared with the previous month's unexpected jump to 6.0% and missing the market's expectedforecastof 4.3%. On a monthly basis, the Spanish Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) measure fell to 1.1% in March from 0.9% recorded in February. The expectations were for a 1.6% reading.

"With the Yen bearing the brunt of the risk rally, the Dollar saw some delayed benefits. Economists at ING believe that theUSD/JPYpair could bounce to the 135 region. Oil-sensitive currencies may continue to enjoy decent momentum “Improving sentiment asymmetrically hits the Yen given it is accompanied by an unwinding of dovishFedbets: the USD/JPY might rebound to the 135.00 area, even though we favour another decline in the pair beyond the short term.” “Oil-sensitive currencies may continue to enjoy decent momentum as we see more upside risks to oil prices. The Canadian Dollar is also benefiting from the general improvement in American (North and Latam) sentiment but lacks a domestic tightening story, so its rally may start to run out of steam sooner than other peers (like MXN and NOK).” “We think the small USD recovery seen yesterday could be one of many along a gradual decline path, but would favour some consolidation around current levels today.” ",1
"Further upside inUSD/JPYcould surpass the 134.00 barrier in the newxt weeks, note UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Market Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that USD ‘downward momentum has waned with the rebound and USD is unlikely to weaken further’ and we expected USD to trade in a range between 130.70 and 131.75. Instead of trading in a range, USD soared to a high of 132.88 before closing on a strong note at 132.84 (+1.51%). The sharp and swift rise has room to extend but deeply overbought conditions suggest a sustained rise above 133.50 is unlikely. The next resistance level of note is at 134.20. On the downside, 132.00 is a solid support (there is a minor support at 132.30).” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have held a negative USD view since early last week. In our update from yesterday (29 Mar, spot at 131.10), we highlighted that ‘downward momentum is waning rapidly and the risk of USD bottoming is increasing’. However, we did not quite expect the manner in which USD jumped to a high of 132.88 before closing higher by a whopping 1.51% (NY close of 132.84). Note the increase of 1.51% is the largest 1-day advance in almost 2 months. Despite the sharp rise, it is premature to expect a major reversal. That said, the current rebound could extend to 134.20. At this stage, a sustained rise above this level is unlikely. Overall, the current upside pressure will remain intact as long as USD stays above 131.20, the current ‘strong support’ level.”",1

"The AUD/USD pair attracts fresh buying near the 0.6660 area on Thursday and builds on its steady intraday ascent through the early part of the European session. The momentum lifts spot prices to a one-week high, around the 0.6820 region in the last hour, though any meaningful upside still seems elusive. The upbeat market mood - as depicted by the ongoing rally in the global equity markets - prompts some selling around the safe-havenUS Dollar(USD) and turns out to be a key factor lending support to the AUD/USD pair. Against the backdrop of easing fears of a widespread banking crisis, hopes for a strong economic recovery in China boost investors' appetite for riskier assets and benefit the China-proxy Australian Dollar. In fact, China's Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the Boao Forum, promised more stimulus to boost domestic spending and reforms that can help stimulate growth. That said, worsening US-China relations, along with the prospect of an imminent pause in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) rate hikes, might hold back bulls from placing aggressive bets around the AUD/USD pair. The markets have been scaling back their bets for any further policy tightening by the RBA amid signs that inflation had peaked and that economic growth was cooling. The expectations were reinforced by the latest Australian consumer inflation figures released on Wednesday, which showed that the headline CPI decelerated to an eight-month low in February. Furthermore, the RBA recently warned that the path to a soft landing for the Australian economy remained a narrow one.  Apart from this, speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will move back to its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes could revive the USD demand and further contribute to capping the upside for the AUD/USD pair. Even from a technical perspective, last week's repeated failures near the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) warrants some caution for aggressive bullish traders and before positioning for any further near-term appreciating move. Market participants now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of the final Q4 GDP print and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims later during the early North American session. This, along with the broader risk sentiment, will influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair. The focus, however, will remain glued to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - the Core PCE Price Index - due on Friday. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",1
"Economists at Crédit Agricole explain why they see downside risks for EUR/USD in the near-term. Fed rate hike expectations are in for a rebound “We continue to see some downside risks for EUR/USD in the near-term. In particular, we think that Fed rate hike expectations are in for a rebound after they have been pared back far too aggressively. We think that abating banking sector risks and evidence on Thursday and Friday that US inflation remains very ‘sticky’ could be the trigger of a renewed move higher in USratesand yields.” “Potential downside surprises from theEurozoneHICP data on Friday could force investors to reassess their stance on the ECB’s policy from here. To the extent that this leads to lower EUR/USD nominal and real rate spreads, it should add to the downside risks for the EUR.” See –EU HICP Preview: Forecasts from seven major banks, headline inflation falls sharply, but core remains high",0
"The GBP/USD pair reverses an intraday dip to sub-1.2300 levels and climbs to its highest level since early February during the first half of the European session on Thursday. The pair currently trades just above the mid-1.2300s and seems poised to prolong its recent upward trajectory from the 1.1800 round-figure mark, or the YTD low touched earlier this March. The global risk sentiment remains well supported by receding concerns over the banking sector, which is seen undermining the safe-havenUS Dollar(USD) and turning out to be a key factor pushing the GBP/USD pair higher. The takeover of Silicon Valley Bank by First Citizens Bank & Trust Company calmed market nerves about the contagion risk. Moreover, the fact that no further cracks have emerged in the banking sector over the past two weeks suggests that a widespread banking crisis might have been averted. The developments continue to boost investors' confidence and drive flows away from traditional safe-haven currencies, including the Greenback. The British Pound, on the other hand, draws additional support from a more hawkish commentary by theBank of England(BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey, saying that interestratesmay have to move higher if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressure. Furthermore, Bailey told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday that the UK banking system is in a strong position and is not experiencing stress linked to the global turmoil in the banking sector. This, in turn, lifted bets for additional rate hikes by the BoE, which continues to act as a tailwind for the Sterling and remains supportive of the GBP/USD pair's strong move up. With the latest leg up, spot prices now seem to have cleared a hurdle near the 1.2345-50 region, which favours bullish traders and supports prospects for a further near-term appreciating move. That said, the lack of strong follow-through buying warrants some caution ahead of the release of the US Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - on Friday. In the meantime, traders on Thursday will take cues from the US economic docket, featuring the final Q4 GDP print and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims. This, along with the broader risk sentiment, might influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to theGBP/USDpair. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
" GBP/USDcontinues to push strongly higher. Economists at Credit Suisse expect the pair to break above the 1.2447/49 December and January highs. GBP/USD could fall back to 1.2009 on a break below 1.2190/57 “We stay bullish for a fresh look at the 1.2447/49 December and January highs. Whilst this should continue to be respected, we are biased to an eventual break of resistance next at 1.2668/1.2768 – the May 2022 high, 61.8% retracement of the 2021/2022 fall and long-term downtrend from May 2021.” “Support at 1.2190/57 now ideally holds to keep the immediate risk higher. A break can see a fall back to 1.2009.”",1
"The US Dollar (USD) started this week under bearish pressure as easing fears over a global financial crisis allowed investors to move toward risk-sensitive assets. After having closed the previous two weeks in negative territory, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) continued to push lower and came within a touching distance of 102.00 before staging a modest rebound early Friday. Renewed expectations about the US Federal Reserve (Fed) pausing its tightening cycle at the upcoming meeting also put additional weight on the USD shoulders. On Friday, the USD staged a technical correction against its major rivals but lost some of its strength after softer-than-expected inflation data. The US Bureau of EconomicAnalysisreported that the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, declined to 4.6% on a yearly basis in February from 4.7% in January. On a monthly basis, Core PCE inflation rose 0.3%, compared to the market expectation of 0.4%. Nevertheless, the DXY remains on track to end the third straight week in negative territory and has lost more than 2% in the month of March. Daily digest market movers: US Dollar struggles to extend rebound Technical analysis: US Dollar on the back foot against Euro EUR/USD bullish bias stays intact in the near term with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the dailychartholding near 60. This technical reading also suggests that the pair has more room on the upside before turning overbought. Additionally, the pair continues to trade above the 50-day Simple Moving Averages after having tested it toward the end of the previous week. 1.0900 (psychological level, static level) aligns as key technical level for EUR/USD. If the pair manages to stabilize above that level, it could target 1.1000 (end-point of the latest uptrend) and 1.1035 (multi-month high set in early February). On the downside, 1.0800 (psychological level) could be seen as interim support ahead of 1.0730 (50-day SMA, 20-day SMA) and 1.0650/60, where the 100-day SMA and the Fibonacci 23.6% retracement of the latest uptrend is located. A daily close below the latter could be seen as a significant bearish development and open the door for an extended slide toward 1.0500 (psychological level) and 1.0460 (Fibonacci 38.2% retracement). How is the US Dollar correlated with US stock markets? Stockmarkets in the US are likely to turn bearish if the Federal Reserve goes into a tightening cycle to battle rising inflation. Higher interestrateswill ramp up the cost of borrowing and weigh on business investment. In that scenario, investors are likely to refrain from taking on high-risk, high-return positions. As a result ofrisk aversionand tight monetary policy, the US Dollar Index should rise while the broad S&P 500 Index declines, revealing an inverse correlation. During times of monetary loosening via lower interest rates and quantitative easing to ramp up economic activity, investors are likely to bet on assets that are expected to deliver higher returns, such as shares of technology companies. The Nasdaq Composite is a technology-heavy index and it is expected to outperform other major equity indexes in such a period. On the other hand, the US Dollar Index should turn bearish due to the risingmoney supplyand the weakening safe-haven demand.",0
"The USD/JPY pair rebounds over 50 pips from the daily low and steadily climbs back closer to the top end of its daily trading range during the first half of the European session. The pair is currently placed around the 132.75 region, nearly unchanged for the day and just below the one-week high touched on Wednesday. An extension of the risk-on rally across the global equity markets undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and assists the USD/JPY pair to attract some dip-buying near the 132.20 area. The global risk sentiment remains well supported by receding fears of a full-blown banking crisis, especially after the takeover of Silicon Valley Bank by First Citizens Bank & Trust Company. Furthermore, no further cracks have emerged in the banking sector over the past two weeks, which boosts investors' appetite for riskier assets and continues to drive flows away from traditional safe-haven currencies, including the JPY. The upside for the USD/JPY pair, meanwhile, remains capped amid the emergence of some selling around theUS Dollar(USD). That said, easing concerns over the banking sector led to fresh speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will move back to its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes. This was seen as a key factor behind the recent strong rally in the US Treasury bond yields, which is seen acting as a tailwind for the Greenback and supports prospects for a further near-term appreciating move for the major. Bulls, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets ahead of the crucial the US Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – which is due for release on Friday and will inform expectations about future rate hikes. This, in turn, will drive the USD demand and provide a fresh directional impetus to theUSD/JPYpair. USD/JPY gains may be limited in the long run, however, by an expected hawkish pivot by the BOJ if it undos years of easy money from an ultra-dovish stimulus approach to monetary policy. Many see the election of a new BOJ governor in the form of Ueda Kazuo as heralding a potential pivot inBOJpolicy. If the Bank does embark on a new tightening path, the effects for the Yen may be dramatic. According to a report from Bloomberg, the Yen could rise rapidly on a backflow of $3.4 trillion of investments made by the Japanese overseas over recent decades, in a effort to eke out yield asratesat home remained perma-low. In the short term, however, traders will take cues from the release of the final US Q4 GDP print on Thursday and the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data for some impetus later during the early North American session. Apart from this, the broader risk sentiment might produce short-term opportunities. From a technical perspective the pair has broken above the trendline capping the move down since the March 7 highs. Wednesday witnessed a strong green breakout candle which suggests more gains could be on the horizon. The only fly in the ointment of the bullish thesis is the location of the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) which sits at 132.85, capping the previous day's gains and providing a tough line of resistance to any further upside. A clear and decisive break above the 50 DMA, as well as a break above the previous higher low at 133.00, is necessary therefore, to provide a confirmation of further gains. Such a move could see USD/JPY recover to 135.00 initially. Alternatively, a break back below the 129.64 lows would reassert the bearish short term trend and see a move lower evolve.

Even though bothFedofficials looked mildly hawkish,investors had begun pricing in a no change to the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) at the upcoming meeting in May. Therefore, the AUD/USD has been underpinned by a probable shift in the US central bank monetary policy stance, though inflation data is waiting to be released on Friday. Aside from this, jobs data from theUnited States(US) showed that the labor market is cooling off, with Initial Jobless Claims for the last week exceeding estimates. At the same time, the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Q4 2022 was 2.6%, below forecasts of 2.7%. On the Australian front, the latest inflation report surprised the market, as inflation was lower than expected. There are growing rumors amongst financial analysts that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could pause rate hikes in the next week. AUD/USD Technical analysis  The AUD/USD is bracing for the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), at 0.6696, consolidating within a narrow 70 pip range during the last three trading days. Although oscillators remain in bearish territory, like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Rate of Change (RoC) is bullish. Hence, mixed signals warrant caution. If the AUD/USD breaks upwards, it will face resistance at the 50-day EMA at 0.6753, followed by the 100 and the 200-day EMAs at 0.6771 and 0.6821, respectively. On the other hand, the AUD/USD first demand level would be the March 24 low at 0.6625, followed by the 0.6600 figure. AUD/USD  ",1

Looking at the hourly chart, recall from yesterday, the pair moved above the 200 hour MA for the first time since March 10, and based against that MA before pushing higher. The price also moved above a swing area between 132.19 to 132.27. That area is a risk level for buyers looking for more upside in the pair (see red numbered circles). Today, the low of that swing area stalled the fall into the early European session and the last 5 or so hours have seen a move higher. The 38.2% of the move down from the March 8 high has been broken. However, the high from March 22 at 132.004 remains the next upside hurdle that needs to be broken to increase the bullish bias.

The Dow Jones rose 140 points or 0.43% to post the highest daily close in two weeks, while the Nasdaq reached seven-month highs. Banking jitters continue to fade, and economic data shows no signs of a “hard” or even “soft” landing.

The bond market does not look as optimistic as stocks. US yields drifted sideways on Thursday, not reflecting risk appetite. Bonds will probably take a more decisive direction after Friday’s US Core Personal Consumption Expenditure data.

"AUD/USD bulls occupy the driver’s seat while reversing the previous weekly losses around 0.6715 as traders await the key inflation clues from the US on Friday. Adding importance to the day’s Asian session are China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs) for March. Receding fears of the banking crisis join the confusion about the future rate hikes among the key central banks to allow the AUD/USD pair to cheer the risk-on mood. Adding strength to the optimism, as well as the Aussie price are the comments from China suggesting higher growth figures in March that the first two months of the year. That said, Fed Chair Jerome Powell teased one more rate hike in the current year and the other policymakers followed the suit while highlighting the task of taming inflation. However, the majority of them appeared cautious of not sounding too hawkish and hence raised doubts that the price pressure is easing. Additionally favoring therisk appetite, as well as the AUD/USD price, were comments suggesting the soundness of the banking sector. It should be noted that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, “Banking system is sound, even as it has come under pressure. Elsewhere, mixed US data, mostly softer, fails to justify the hawkishFedconcerns and allow the Aussie pair to grind higher. On Thursday, final readings of the US fourth quarter (Q4) Gross Domestic Product (GDP), also known as the Real GDP, marked an easy Annualized growth number of 2.6% versus 2.7% previous forecasts. It’s worth noting that the Q4 Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Prices matched 3.7% QoQ forecasts and prior while the Core PCE figure grew to 4.4% QoQ versus 4.3% expected and prior. Moving on, the Weekly Initial Jobless Claims rose to 198K for the week ended on March 25 versus 191K prior and 196K market forecasts. Alternatively, China's Taiwan Affairs Office threatened retaliation over Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's visit to the US on Wednesday. Additionally, China's Premier Li Qiang recently said that the economic situation in March is even better than in January and February. The policymaker, however, also raised geopolitical tension by opposing trade protectionism and decoupling, which indirectly targets the US. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed positive but the yields grind higher and weigh on theUS Dollar.

"The EUR/USD pairhas shown decent buying interest after a gradual correction to near the round-level support of 1.0900 in the late New York session. The major currency pair has resumed its upside journey as investors are anticipating more rate hikes from theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) as German inflation remained higher than expected. In Germany, prices of goods and services in March have accelerated by 1.1%, higher than the consensus of 0.8% and the former release of 1.0%. Annual German Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) landed at 7.8%, significantly lower than the prior release of 9.3% but higher than the estimates of 7.5%. Annual HICP figures have softened firmly led by lower energy prices, however, prices of core products look solid amid the shortage of labor. The labor market has grabbed the bargaining power due to a shortage of job seekers and wage growth is now at between 5% and 6%, the highest in decades, as reported by Reuters. This has bolstered the case for more rate hikes from ECB President Christine Lagarde. On Friday, the release of Eurozone HICP and GermanRetail Salesdata will provide more clarity. Annual preliminaryEurozoneHICP is expected to decelerate to 7.1% vs. the prior print of 8.5%. Along with them, monthly German Retail Sales are expected to expand by 0.5% against a contraction of 0.3%. Meanwhile, the upside bias for the shared currency pair is also backed by the decliningUS Dollar Index(DXY). The USD Index is juggling after a fresh weekly low at 102.07. The USD Index failed to capitalize on the anticipation of one more rate hike this year by Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell in a private meeting with United States lawmakers.

In doing so, the Euro pair portrays another battle with the key horizontal resistance established on January 23.

The data is of high relevance for the financial markets throughout several asset classes, given China’s influence on the global economy. China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) publishes the non-manufacturing PMI on a monthly basis.

Investors are split about the monetary policy decision by RBAGovernor Philip Loweas Australian inflation has softened to 6.8% firmly from the December print of 8.4%, which supports the case of keeping policy steady and observing the impact of the current interest rate. Also, RBA Lowe cited in its previous policy statement that the central bank is considering maintenance of the status quo in April. While, the other school of thought believes that despite softening of Australian inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is still far from the desired target.

"EUR/USD has corrected gradually to near 1.0900 after failing to surpass Thursday’s high around 1.0926 in the early European session. The major currency pair has sensed selling pressure as investors have turned cautious ahead of the release of the Eurozone preliminary Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) andUnited Statescore Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index data. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) has shown signs of recovery, building a cushion above 102.10. The downside bets for the USD Index have been trimmed as investors are anticipating a rate hike in May monetary policy meeting by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The approach for May policy has changed swiftly as waning fears of further casualty in the US banking system have opened room for the continuation of a policy-tightening spell by the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, gains generated by the S&P500 futures in the Asian session are halved now as investors are getting anxious ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation tool. However, the overall market mood is quite bullish. The demand for US government bonds has turned subdued as investors are shrugging off the US banking collapse event. The 10-year US Treasury yields are choppy around 3.55%. Odds for a steady Federal Reserve policy have trimmed Ebbing fears of further US banking turmoil have infused enormous confidence among market participants. Investors are not anticipating any recession warnings amid waning baking jitters, which has supported demand for USequities. Fading banking jitters have also restored confidence among Federal Reserve policymakers that the hiking spell can be continued to tame persistent US inflation. In a private meeting with US lawmakers, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell cited that he anticipates one more rate hike in 2023. As per the CME Fedwatch tool, chances of a 25 basis points (bp) rate hike have scaled above 53%, which will pushratesto 5.00-5.25%. Adding to that, Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said on Thursday that he is content with the current trajectory set by the FOMC of evaluating whether a 25 bps interest rate hike is required at each meeting. According to Barkin, there is a lot of money available for spending among households. He further added, “It is possible that tightening credit conditions, along with the lagged effect of our rate moves, will bring inflation down relatively quickly. But I still think it could take time for inflation to return to target.” For further clarity, investors will keep an eye on US core PCE Price Index data. Analysts at Wells Fargo have forecasted the PCE deflator (+0.4%) to outpace nominal spending (+0.3%). Higher labor shortage cements further acceleration in Eurozone Inflation Considering cues from the German HICP released on Thursday, it is highly likely that Eurozone headline inflation would soften dramatically led by lower energy prices. As per the consensus, the Eurozone headline HICP is expected to soften to 7.1% from the former release of 8.5%. The economic indicator that could propel the need of more rate hikes from the European Central Bank (ECB) is the extreme shortage of labor in the Eurozone. Bargaining power has shifted to talent due to a shortage of job seekers, which also allowed wage growth to scale higher. The Labor cost index in Eurozone is shuffling between 5% and 6%, the highest in decades, as reported by Reuters. Therefore, coreEurozoneInflation data could turn sticky further as households are equipped with sufficient funds for disposal. The street is anticipating thatEuropean Central BankPresidentChristine Lagardewill hike rates further ahead. EUR/USD technical outlook  EUR/USD is forming a Double Top chart pattern near 1.0926 on an hourly scale, which indicates an absence of sheer buying interest while surpassing previous highs. The Double Topchartpattern has not been triggered yet as the asset is continued with higher highs and higher lows structure. This could be a corrective move after a perpendicular rally by the Euro. The critical support is plotted around 1.0890 whose breakdown could activate the Double Top formation. Upward-sloping 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.0890 is providing a cushion to the Euro. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has slipped into the 40.00-60.00 range from the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates a loss in the upside momentum. EUR/USD  ",0
"GBP/USD shows little reaction to better-than-forecast UK economic growth numbers during early Friday. The reason could be linked to the market’s cautious mood ahead of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred inflation gauge. That said, the UK’s fourth quarter (Q4) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) came in at 0.1% QoQ versus 0.0% prior forecasts while the yearly figures appear more impressive with 0.6% YoY growth for the Q4 GDP compared to 0.4% earlier estimations. It’s worth noting that the UK’s National Housing Prices for March and Total Business Investment for the Q4 appear dismal and might have probed the GBP/USD bulls ahead of the key US data. Also read:UK Final GDP revised up to 0.1% QoQ in Q4 vs. 0% expected Even so, optimism surrounding the UK’s £ 1.8 billion trade deal with Trans-Pacific nations joins the Brexit optimism to favor the bulls. In this regard, the Financial Times (FT) said, “The UK on Friday unveiled an agreement to join an 11-member Asia-Pacific trade bloc, with British prime minister Rishi Sunak claiming it proved his government was seizing ‘post-Brexit freedoms’.” Also positive was thenewssuggesting the higher inflation and the Bank of England’s (BoE) hawkish concerns as Reuters said, “British businesses were their most confident this month since May 2022 and pricing expectations, which are being watched by the Bank of England as it grapples with high inflation, cooled to a six-month low, a survey showed on Friday.” On the other hand, easing hawkishFedbets and mixed US data, as well as receding pessimism surrounding the global banking sector seem to weigh on theUS Dollarahead of the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index for February. It’s worth noting that the US Treasury bond yields’ latest retreat allows the US Dollar to pare recent losses and weigh on the GBP/USD as traders wait for inflation data amid hawkish Fed talks. Technical analysis Although the overbought RSI (14) might have triggered the GBP/USD pair’s pullback, the 10-week-old horizontal resistance-turned-support around 1.2285-65 appears a tough nut to crack forthe Cablebears to break.

"Economists at ANZ Bank expect the AUD/USD pair to reach the 0.75 mark by the end of the year. However, the Aussie could struggle in the near term. AUD upside through 2023 driven by USD weakness “We see the AUD finishing the year higher against the USD. This is mostly a function of a valuation unwind in the USD, which is still commanding a premium of more than 10% to our measure of fair value. This adjustment process won’t be linear, however, and the lower interest rate structure leaves the AUD vulnerable on cross exposures.” “We expect downward pressure on the AUD/JPY as defensive flows and continued expectations of a policy reset will drive JPY higher.” “We maintain our year-endforecastof 0.75 for AUD/USD but acknowledge that in the short term, fears about a global banking crisis are unlikely to inspire strongrisk appetite, which may keep a lid on any upside.” ",1
"AUD/USDcould still see its upside reinvigorated on a breakout fo the 0.6760 level, according to Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia at UOB Group.

Upward momentum has improved, albeit not much. Today, AUD could edge higher but it is unlikely to challenge the major 0.6760 (there is another resistance at 0.6730). On the downside, a breach of 0.6685 (minor support is at 0.6700) would indicate that the current mild upward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (30 Mar, spot at 0.6680), we highlighted, that ‘While AUD could edge lower, it has to break clearly below 0.6625 before a sustained decline is likely’. We added, ‘The likelihood of a clear break below 0.6625 is low for now’. AUD subsequently rebounded and downward momentum has fizzled out. After rising to a high of 0.6718, upward momentum has improved somewhat instead. However, this time around, AUD has to break clearly above 0.6760 before a sustained advance is likely. The prospect of a clear break of 0.6760 is not high but it would remain intact as long as AUD stays above 0.6655 in the next 1-2 days.”",1

"The USD/JPY pair regains positive traction on the last day of the week and maintains its bid tone near a two-week high, just below mid-133.00s through the early part of the European session. The recent risk-on rally across the global equity markets undermines the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY), which, along with the emergence of someUS Dollar(USD) buying, acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. Investors now seem convinced that a widespread banking crisis might have been averted. Apart from this, hopes for a strong economic recovery in China further boost investors' confidence. In fact, the official Chinese PMI data showed that business activity in the services sector grew at its fastest pace in 12 years in March. Meanwhile, the growth in the manufacturing sector moderated a bit during the reported month, albeit at a smaller-than-expected pace. The USD, on the other hand, draws some support from a modest uptick in the US Treasury bond yields, bolstered by fresh speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) might move back to its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes. Furthermore, three Fed officials on Thursday backed the case for more rate increases to lower high levels of inflation. The US central bank, however, had signalled recently that it might soon pause the rate-hiking cycle in the wake of the turmoil in the banking sector. This, in turn, could act as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair. Traders also seem reluctant to place aggressive bets and might prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the release of the US Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - later during the early North American session. The data will play a key role in influencing market expectations about the future rate hike path, which, in turn, will drive the USD demand and provide a fresh directional impetus to theUSD/JPYpair. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to register strong weekly gains for the first time in the previous five. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1
" The annualized EurozoneHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices(HICP) came in softer at 6.9% in March vs. February’s 8.5%, the latest data published by Eurostat showed on Friday. The market expected the inflation gauge to drop to 7.1% in the reported period. The core HICP steadied at 5.7% YoY in March when compared to 5.7% expected and 5.6% recorded in the February clip. On a monthly basis, the old continent’s HICP unexpectedly rose by 0.9% in March vs. 0.8% expectations and 0.8% previous. The core HICP arrived at 1.2% last month as against the 0.6% expected and 0.8% seen in February. The Euro area inflation data is released a day after Germany’s annual HICP for March, which rose by 7.8%, beating 7.5% estimates while following a 9.3% advance seen in February. Note that the European Central Bank’s (ECB) inflation target is 2%. Investors closely scrutinize the bloc’s HICP figures to evaluate theECBrate hike expectations.

"The Pound is set to be the best-performing currency of the first quarter of 2023, having gained 2.5% against the Dollar. Economists at ING think EUR/USD may break 1.10 next week. If that is the case, Cable should follow with a break above 1.25. No reasons to diverge from EUR “We have been stressing how markets are rewarding currencies that can count on domestic tightening prospects despite financial turmoil, and the Pound is indeed one of those.” “While our more dovish view for the BoE compared to theECBkeeps us bullish onEUR/GBPfor the remainder of the year (we still target 0.90 in the second half of the year), there aren’t clear short-term drivers to buck the bullish GBP trend at the moment.” “Cable is approaching some important levels. First of all, the 1.2426 December 2022 high, and then the key 1.2500 benchmark level. With no obvious catalyst driving divergence between EUR and GBP at the moment, a high chance of 1.1000 being tested next week in EUR/USD equals a high chance of 1.2500 being tested next week in Cable.” ",1

But with the market still priced for about 50 bps of easing from theFedby year-end, that spread looks set to continuing supporting EUR/USD for now. We remain wary over that spread dynamic remaining so compelling which could prompt a correction in EUR/USD – next week’s US data may be the catalyst for that if the data remains resilient.” “Month-end (quarter-end and FY-end for Japan) FX flows today could also spark some unpredictable moves that could alter the complexion of the market ahead of the key data from the US next week.” ",0
"The GBP/USD pair comes under some selling pressure after touching over a two-month high, around the 1.2420-1.2425 area on Friday and maintains its offered tone through the first half of the European session. The pair is currently placed near the lower end of its daily trading range, around the 1.2370-1.2365 zone, down nearly 0.15% for the day. A goodish pickup in the US Treasury bond yields helps revive theUS Dollar(USD) demand on the last day of the week, which turns out to be a key factor dragging the GBP/USD pair lower. Hopes that a widespread banking crisis might have been averted fueled speculations that the US central bank might move back to its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes. Adding to this, threeFedofficials on Thursday backed the case for more rate increases to lower high levels of inflation. This, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the US bond yields and lends some support to the Greenback. Hence, the market focus will remain glued to the release of the US Core PCE Price Index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, due later during the early North American session. Heading into the key data risk, traders seem inclined to lighten their bullish bets around the GBP/USD pair, especially after this week's rally of over 200 pips. That said, the slightly better-than-expected UK GDP print reaffirms expectations for additional rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE), which, in turn, holds back bearish traders from placing aggressive bets around the major, at least for now. Apart from this, the prevalent risk-on mood - as depicted by an extension of the recent rally in the equity markets - keeps a lid on any meaningful gains for the safe-haven buck and contributes to limiting the downside for theGBP/USDpair. This makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that the upward trajectory witnessed since the first half of the current month has run out of steam and positioning for any meaningful depreciating move. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to end in positive territory for the sixth successive week. From a technical perspective GBP/USD appears to have reached a make-or-break level at around 1.2375 at the upper borderline of a broad sideways range that has unfolded since the start of the year. If the market's ranging mode extends, the pair may pivot at the current level and then begin falling back down towards the range lows in the 1.18s. Currently it is too early to say for sure whether it will reverse and there are no technical indications of a reversal, such as a bearish Japanesecandlestickpattern or overbought RSI. If the pair pushes out above the highs of the range the move will need to be strong to suggest an extension higher. The pair has reached an important inflection point on thechartand traders should monitor developments closely over the next few days for a steer on GBP/USD's future course.

"The USD/JPY pair surrenders a major part of its intraday gains to a two-week high and retreats below the 133.00 round-figure mark during the early North American session on Friday. The modest intradayUS Dollar(USD) uptick loses steam after the US Bureau of EconomicAnalysisreported that the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index decelerated to a 5% YoY rate in February from 5.3% previous. Adding to this, the Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - unexpectedly edged lower to a 4.6% YoY rate from 4.7% in January. The data adds to the uncertainty about the Fed's rate-hike path, which acts as a headwind for the Greenback and prompts some intraday selling around the USD/JPY pair. Bearish traders further took cues from a modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields, which results in the narrowing of the US-Japan rate differential and benefits the Japanese Yen (JPY). That said, the underlying bullish tone around the global equity markets - amid easing fears of a full-blown banking crisis - continues to undermine the safe-haven JPY and remains supportive of a mildly positive tone around the USD/JPY pair. This, in turn, warrants caution for bearish traders and before positioning for any meaningful corrective pullback. Friday's US economic docket also features the release of the Chicago PMI and revised Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, though might do little to provide any meaningful impetus.

In fact, the US Bureau of EconomicAnalysisreported that the headline PCE Price Index decelerated to a 5% YoY rate in February - the slowest pace of rise since September 2021. Adding to this, the Fed's favourite inflation indicator - Core PCE Deflator - edged down to 4.7% during the reported month against consensus estimates pointing to a steady reading of 4.7%. The data fuels speculations that the Federal Reserve might soon pause the rate-hiking cycle in the wake of the turmoil in the banking sector, which is evident from a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields. This, along with the prevalent risk-on mood, acts as a headwind for the safe-haven Greenback and lends support to the GBP/USD pair. The British Pound is further underpinned by the prospects for additional interest rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE). The bets were reaffirmed by the UK GDP print, which showed that the economy expanded by 0.1% during the fourth quarter. The fundamental backdrop favours bullish traders and suggests that the path of least resistance for theGBP/USDpair is to the upside. Hence, any meaningful pullback might still be seen as a buying opportunity and is more likely to remain limited, at least for the time being. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to register strong weekly gains and end in the green for the sixth successive week. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",0

"The Pound Sterling (GBP) traded with decent losses in the mid-North American session, pressured by a resurgence of the US Dollar (USD), trimming its Thursday’s losses. Although inflation data could spur a pivot in the US Federal Reserve (Fed) policy stance, market participants buy theUS Dollaras the weekly, monthly, and quarter-end looms. At the time of writing, theGBP/USDis trading at 1.2331. US inflation edged lower, though Fed officials remain resilient in fighting inflation USeconomic datafrom the Department of Commerce revealed that the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the core PCE rose 4.6% YoY, beneath forecasts and a prior’s month reading of 4.7%. Headline inflation was 5%, beneath January’s 5.3%, signaling that the cumulative tightening by the Fed continues to temper inflation. The Fed Boston President Susan Collins welcomed the news but reiterated that the Fed has work to do. The New York Fed President, John Williams, will cross newswires later. On other data, the University of Michigan (UoM) showed that Consumer Sentiment on its final March reading was 62, worse than expected. At the same time, inflation expectations dropped. For the one-year horizon, the estimated inflation rate is 3.6%, while for the 5-year horizon, consumers estimate inflation to be 2.9%. After the US inflation data release, the GBP/USD hovered around 1.2400 before collapsing beneath the central pivot point at 1.2357 and extending its losses towards the 1.2340 area. However, an upward correction was capped at the former, and the GBP/USD resumed its downward trajectory, eyeing a test of the S1 pivot at 1.2320. On the UK front, the economy expanded by 0.1% in Q4 2022, and by 0.6% YoY, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). GBP/USD Technical analysis  From a dailychartperspective, the GBP/USD would remain trading sideways after diving below 1.2400. However, the GBP/USD could consolidate in the 1.2300-1.2400 area before extending its recovery past the 1.2423 YTD high. That would pave the way towards 1.2500, with upside risks at a May 27 high of 1.2666. Otherwise, if the GBP/USD prints a close at around 1.2300, that could form a bearish engulfing candle pattern, setting the major for a pullback toward the 20-day Moving Average (MA) at 1.2213.

"The Australian Dollar (AUD) retraces after hitting a weekly high of 0.6738, spurred on the American Dollar (USD) recovery as it got bolstered by weekly, monthly, and quarter-end flows. Wall Street is set to finish the week with gains, while US inflation data could cement the case for a pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle. The AUD/USD is trading at 0.6684, below its opening price by 0.43%. AUD/USD dwindles below 0.6700 on a buoyant US Dollar The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE published by the US Department of Commerce, increased 4.6% YoY, lower than forecasts and beneath the previous month. Headline inflation was 5%, signaling that the Fed's tightening measures are still curbing inflation. Susan Collins, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, expressed approval for thenewsbut emphasized that theFed still has work to accomplish. The University of Michigan's (UoM) Consumer Sentiment on its final March reading was 62, worse than expected. At the same time, inflation expectations dropped. For the one-year horizon, American consumersforecastinflation at 3.6%, while for the 5-year horizon, inflation estimations dipped to 2.9%. Of late, the New York Fed President John Williams said that anuncertain economic outlook and economic datawould drive monetary policy. Williams expect inflation to drop to 3.5%, and the Gross Domestic Prodcut (GDP) to contract slightly before rebounding in 2024. On inflation data, the AUD/USD reacted upwards to 0.6718 before reversing its course, fell sharply below the 0.6700 figure, and printed a daily low of 0.6670. Since then, the AUD/USD stabilized at around 0.6686. On the Australian front, inflation data would give cues regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) forward path. The TD Securities Inflation for February was 6.3% YoY, and any readings below the latter can discourage the RBA from continuing to tighten monetary conditions. TDS expects an RBA’s pause on its tightening campaign TD Securities Analysts in a note, “The Apr meeting is a close one, with analysts mixed about the RBA decision and markets pricing in no hike from the RBA.We now expect the Bank to pause at the April meeting given the lower Jan-Feb CPI prints and uncertainty over the outlook from the banking turmoilin the near-term.” AUD/USD Technical analysis  The AUD/USD is trading sideways, as shown by its dailychart, though tilted to the downside. For a bearish continuation, sellers need to reclaim the March 24 swing low at 0.6625, exposing the YTD lows at 0.6564. Once cleared, and the path towards November 10 at 0.6386 is on the cards. On the flip side, if buyers crack 0.6700, that could keep them hopeful that the AUD/USD could test 0.6800 in the near term. What to watch? ",0
"The Euro (EUR) drops from around weekly highs of 1.0925 on a buoyantUS Dollar(USD) and on buyers’ failure to crack the YTD high at 1.0929. Nevertheless, a triple bottom in the daily chart is intact, at the brisk of being negated. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD is trading at 1.0842. EUR/USD Price action Failure to hold prices above the 1.0900 figure has exposed the EUR/USD to further selling pressure. A triple bottom in the dailychartremains in play. But, the upward movement was capped at around March’s 23 high of 1.0929, ahead of testing 1.1000. For a bullish resumption, EUR/USD buyers must reclaim 1.0900, followed by 1.0929. Break above will expose the 1.1000 figure, followed by the YTD high at 1.1032. Another scenario has developed in the last couple of weeks. Albeit a “triple bottom” is in place, the formation of a double top emerged. Hence, if the EUR/USD continues to dive further and achieves a daily close below the March 24 swing low of 1.0713, it would pave the way to test 1.0500. Backing up the latter scenario are oscillators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), although at bullish territory, its slope turned downwards, while the Rate of Change (RoC) shifted neutral.

"GBP/USD begins the week’s trading on a back foot after witnessing three consecutive weekly gains in the last, down 0.25% around 1.2310 by the press time. In doing so,the Cablepair justifies the downside break of a two-week-old ascending support line, now resistance around 1.2365. Adding strength to the quote’s bearish bias is one more reversal from the 1.2445-50 resistance zone which has been restricting the quote’s upside since early December 2022. Additionally, a looming bear cross on the MACD and a steady RSI (14) line also suggest that the GBP/USD pair could consolidate the latest weekly gains. However, a convergence of the 50-DMA and 100-DMA, near 1.2140-45, appears a tough nut to crack for the Cable pair bears. Following that, an upward-sloping support line from November, close to 1.1940 by the press time, can challenge the GBP/USD pair sellers. Meanwhile, recovery moves not only need validation from the support-turned-resistance line of around 1.2365 but also need to provide a successful upside break of the 1.2445-50 area to convince the GBP/USD buyers. Should the Cable pair manage to remain firmer past 1.2450, a run-up toward the May 2022 high of around 1.2665 can’t be ruled out.

Adding strength to the pullback moves could be the recent fears of escalating pressure on prices and downbeatEurozoneinflation numbers versus firmer prints of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) favorite inflation gauge. The recent surprise supply cut from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, known as OPEC+, renew inflation fears and propel the concerns of higherrates, which in turn underpinned the US Dollar’s haven demand. Adding strength to theUS Dollarcould be the recently firmer inflation signals as the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, declined to 4.6% YoY in February from 4.7% expected and prior. On a monthly basis, Core PCE inflation rose 0.3% while easing below the market expectation of 0.4% and a downwardly revised 0.5% previous reading. On the other hand, the Eurozone Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the European Central Bank’s (ECB) preferred version of inflation, eased to 6.5% YoY in March versus February’s 8.5% and 7.1% market forecasts. It’s worth noting, however, that the Core HICP matched 5.7% analysts’ estimations and 5.6% prior. The monthly figures were more interesting as the headline HICP rose by 0.9% in March vs. 0.8% expectations and 0.8% previous while the Core HICP jumped by 1.2% compared to 0.6% expected and 0.8% seen in February. It should be noted that the latest comments from theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) Officials, namely from Vice-President Luis de Guindos and policymaker Fabio Panetta hint at easing inflation pressure but defend the hawkish monetary policy bias. On the other hand, FedChairman Jerome Powellpushed for one more rate hike while Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Susan Collins highlighted the importance of higher rates to tame inflation during her latest speeches. On the same line, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John C. Williams said that he expects inflation to decline to around 3-1/4 percent this year, before moving closer to our longer-run goal in the next two years. Against this backdrop, S&P 500 Futures print mild losses despite the upbeat closing of Wall Street whereas yields grind higher after a three-day downtrend. Moving on, US ISM Manufacturing PMI and S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for March can direct intraday moves but major attention should be given to Friday’s US jobs report and headlines suggesting inflation woes.

Also, the annual US PCE Inflation figure soften to 4.6% from the consensus and prior release of 4.7%.

The USD Index has refreshed its weekly high above 103.00 as higher United States inflation expectations were prompted by upbeat oil prices. Acceleration in the oil price is expected to fuel inflationary pressures as producers would offset the impact of costly oil by hiking prices of goods and services at factory gates.

"USD/JPY takes the bids to refresh intraday high near 133.50 as bulls keep the reins after witnessing the first weekly gain in five. The Yen pair’s latest gains could be linked to the firmer US Treasury bond yields, as well as theUS Dollar, as markets await the all-importantNonfarm Payrolls(NFP), up for publishing on Friday. Adding strength to the USD/JPY pair’s run-up could be the latest challenges to the sentiment, mainly emanating from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies led by Russia, known as OPEC+. However, the mixed data at home and anxiety ahead of top-tier US statistics challenge the pair buyers of late. Japan’s Tankan Large Manufacturing Index for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023, a closely observed output guide by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), eased to 1.0 from 7.0 previous readings and 3.0 expected. On the other hand, Japan’s Jibun Bank Manufacturing PMI for March improved to 49.2 from 48.6 previous. However, the below-50 figure suggests a contraction in private manufacturing activities. On the other hand, the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, declined to 4.6% YoY in February from 4.7% expected and prior. On a monthly basis, Core PCE inflation rose 0.3% while easing below the market expectation of 0.4% and a downwardly revised 0.5% previous reading. It’s worth observing that the receding hawkish calls surrounding the Bank of Japan (BoJ) also favor USD/JPY buyers. However, the recent easing calls of the Fed’s hawkish moves, as well as easing fears of the banking crisis, seem to gain little attention. Against this backdrop, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rises 1.0% intraday to 28,041 by the press time but the S&P 500 Futures snapped a three-day uptrend near the highest levels since mid-February. On the other hand, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields print mild gains near 3.52% and 4.11% while paring the latest losses.

S&P500 futures are auctioning in a negative trajectory in the early European session amid higher oil prices propelled by fears of further oil production cuts by OPEC+, portraying a risk-aversion theme.

As per the CME Fedwatch tool, the odds for a 25bp rate hike to 5.00-5.25% for May monetary policy meeting have soared above 61%. Going forward, the US ISM Manufacturing PMI data will keep investors busy. According to the consensus, the Manufacturing PMI is expected to decline marginally to 47.5 from the former release of 47.7. Investors should be aware that the US Manufacturing PMI has remained below 50.0 consecutively in the past four months. From the US Manufacturing PMI gamut, New Orders Index would hog the limelight as it provides cues about the manufacturingoutlook.

Theeconomic datahas landed at 50.0, lower than the consensus of 51.7 and the former release of 51.5. Being the leading trading partner of China, the Australian Dollar was impacted by a decline in the scale of manufacturing activities in the Chinese economy.

"Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia at UOB Group now seeGBP/USDnavigating within the 1.2190/1.2380 range in the next few weeks. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We highlighted that last Friday that ‘the chance of GBP breaking above 1.2400 is on the high side’. We added, ‘the next resistance at 1.2450 is a significant level and might not be easy to breach’. While our view was not wrong as GBP rose above 1.2400 (high of 1.2423), we did not anticipate the sharp drop from the high. GBP could continue to decline today but oversold conditions suggest it might not be able to maintain a foothold below 1.2260. Resistance is at 1.2330, a breach of 1.2355 would indicate that the current downward pressure has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Last Friday (31 Mar, spot at 1.2385), we held the view that GBP ‘is likely to head higher to 1.2450’. GBP rose to a high of 1.2423 and then dropped sharply from the high. In early Asian trade today, it took out our ‘strong support’ level of 1.2300. The breach of 1.2300 indicates that GBP is not strengthening further. While the immediate pressure is on the downside, we view any decline as part of a 1.2190/1.2380 range. In other words, we do not expect a clear break below 1.2190.”",1

"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will hold its monthly meeting on Tuesday. The key question is whether the RBA will take a break in its rate hike cycle and how it expects interestratesto develop in the near future, economists at Commerzbank report. Will the RBA pause its rate hike cycle? “There is certainly a risk that after a cumulative 350 basis points of rate hikes, the RBA will pause for now and wait for the quarterly price index and another labor market report.” “Still, it could emphasize the possibility of further hikes and make them conditional on the next data releases. This would take some wind out of the market's rate cut expectations. The Aussie would certainly benefit from such an outcome.” ",1

"The GBP/USD pair attracts dip-buying buying near the 1.2275 area, or a one-week low touched earlier this Monday, and builds on its intraday ascent. Spot prices climb to a fresh daily high above 1.2400 after the relese of lower-than-forecast ISM Manufacturing PMI data, which showed US purchasing managers believed there was a fall in activity in March. This makes the market wary of further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and weighs on theUS Dollar(USD), but lifts the GBP/USD over the psychologically significant 1.2400 hurdle. US ISM Manufacturing PMI for March comes out at 46.3, falling below expectations of 47.5 and lower than the previous month's 47.7 on Monday. The prices paid component, which is of particular interest to currency traders because it impacts on inflation expectations and therefore the policy trajectory of the Federal Reserve, also under-shoots forecasts, coming out at 49.2 when a rise to 53.8 had beenforecast, from a previous 51.3. This also reflects a watershed moment since it shows a dip below the 50 mark which distinguishes growth from contraction, suggesting prices for manufactured goods are actually falling (deflationary). The employment component also shows a fall to 46.9 versus the 49.8 expected, and new orders to 44.3 from estimates of 44.6. All in all the data weighs on the US Dollar. Further, the prevalent risk-on mood - as depicted by a generally positive tone around the equity markets - is seen weighing on traditional safe-haven assets, including the Greenback. Apart from this, the prospects for additional interest rate hikes by theBank of England(BoE) underpin the British Pound and contributes to the pair's goodish intraday rally of over 120 pips. It is worth recalling that BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said last week that interestratesmay have to move higher if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressure. Adding to this, the final UK GDP print released on Friday showed that the economy expanded by 0.1% in Q4 and avoided a technical recession, reaffirming hawkish BoE expectations. The Federal Reserve (Fed), meanwhile, is also anticipated to stick to its inflation-fighting rate hikes amid worries that rising energy prices will push inflation higher. In fact, the current market pricing indicates around a 55% chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC monetary policy meeting in May. This week's rather busy US economic docket sees JOLTS Job Openings on Tuesday, the ADP report on private-sector employment and ISM Services PMI on Wednesday, and the crucial US monthly employment report - popularly known as NFP - on Friday. The latter will influence the near-term USD price dynamics and determine the next leg of a directional move for theGBP/USDpair. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
"Following the rebound witnessed on Friday, the US Dollar (USD) started the new week on a bullish note and theUS Dollar Index(DXY) recovered toward 103.00 during the Asian trading hours. In the second half of the day, however, the disappointing ISM Manufacturing PMI report for March caused the USD to weaken against its rivals. As market participants reassess the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) rate outlook amid renewed concerns over energy inflation turning uncomfortably high, the DXY stays on the back foot. Meanwhile, Wall Street's main indexes opened higher led by impressive gains witnessed in energy shares following OPEC+ decision to cut oil output. Daily digest market movers: US Dollar turns fragile after PMI data Technical analysis: US Dollar shows no signs of recovery against Euro Despite the modest retreat witnessed at the beginning of the week, EUR/USD keeps its bullish following the latest rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the daily chart stays near 60 and the pair holds comfortably above the 20-day and the 50-day SMAs, which are about to make a bullish cross. On the upside, EUR/USD faces first resistance at 1.0900 (psychological level, static level). If the pair manages to make a daily close above that level and confirms it as support, it could extend its uptrend toward 1.1000 (end-point of the latest uptrend) and 1.1035 (multi-month high set in early February). EUR/USD’s latest pullback confirmed 1.0800 (psychological level, static level) as support. A daily close below that level could open the door for further losses toward 1.0730 (20-day SMA, 50-day SMA) and the 1.0650/60 area, where the 100-day SMA and the Fibonacci 23.6% retracement of the latest uptrend align. How is US Dollar correlated with US stock markets? Stock markets in the US are likely to turn bearish if the Federal Reserve goes into a tightening cycle to battle rising inflation. Higher interest rates will ramp up the cost of borrowing and weigh on business investment. In that scenario, investors are likely to refrain from taking on high-risk, high-return positions. As a result ofrisk aversionand tight monetary policy, the US Dollar Index (DXY) should rise while the broad S&P 500 Index declines, revealing an inverse correlation. During times of monetary loosening via lower interest rates and quantitative easing to ramp up economic activity, investors are likely to bet on assets that are expected to deliver higher returns, such as shares of technology companies. The Nasdaq Composite is a technology-heavy index and it is expected to outperform other major equity indexes in such a period. On the other hand, the US Dollar Index should turn bearish due to the risingmoney supplyand the weakening safe-haven demand.",0
"The JPY is back as the “safe haven” of choice, as recent “risk off” periods have been associated with falling US yields. If banking-related anxiety does not intensify, this would point to a weaker JPY over the near term, but economists at HSBC believe local factors should provide support for the JPY later in the year. Near-term sideways, but longer-term strength “If banking-related anxiety does not intensify, this would point to a weaker JPY against ‘risk on’ currencies over the near term. However, it may be possible for local news to get some traction in the JPY. If thenewsflow on Japanese wages remains favourable, then this could counter some JPY downside. As such, we expectUSD/JPYto move largely sideways in the weeks ahead.” “Beyond the near-term movements, the rationale supporting the JPY’s appreciation later in the year remains intact. For example, compared to early January, more Japan economists now think that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will modify its yield curve control (YCC) policy this year. Japan’s trade deficit widened to a record level in January 2023, but this was likely exacerbated by holiday-related distortions and a lagged pass-through of lower oil prices. Subsequent numbers should be better.” ",1
"EUR/USD rebounds from below 1.08. Still, a break past 1.0930 is needed to extend the rise, economists at Scotiabank report. Key support is 1.0700 “EUR gains have lost some technical momentum on the short-term charts but the underlying trend higher remains intact.” “Firm gains from below the 1.08 level suggest the undertone remains relatively constructive but new cycle highs (above 1.0930) are needed to give the EUR a bit more lift in the short run and drive gains on through 1.10+.” “Support is 1.0800/25. Key support is 1.0700.” ",1
"GBP/USDbounces nicely from the 1.2275 area. Economists at Scotiabank expect the pair to pressure the 1.2445/50 resistance. Bull trend holds “Mar CIPS Manufacturing data was revised down slightly (47.9, from 48.0) but the data had little impact on the GBP which has traded steadily higher from the session low just under 1.23.” “The Pound remains in a solid, short-term uptrend. Broader technical signals remain positive and underlying trend signals are aligned positively for the GBP. This implies limited downside for the GBP for the moment and ongoing pressure for a retest – at least – of key, medium-term resistance at 1.2445/50.”",1
"The AUD/USD pair rebounds sharply from a four-day high, around the 0.6650 area touched earlier this Monday and builds on its solid intraday recovery through the early US session. Spot prices spike to the 0.6770 area, or a nearly one-month top after the release of lower-than-expected US ISM PMI data, with bulls building on earlier momentum further beyond a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). US ISM Manufacturing PMI for March comes out at 46.3, falling below expectations of 47.5 and lower than the previous month's 47.7 on Monday. The prices paid component, which is of particular interest to currency traders because it impacts on inflation expectations and therefore the policy trajectory of the Federal Reserve, also under-shoots forecasts, coming out at 49.2 when a rise to 53.8 had beenforecast, from a previous 51.3.

The employment component also shows a fall to 46.9 versus the 49.8 expected, and new orders to 44.3 from estimates of 44.6. All in all the data weighs on the US Dollar. Set against the data is the potential inflationary impact of a sharp rise in Oil prices. Yet, the prevalent risk-on environment attracts fresh sellers around the safe-havenUS Dollar(USD) and turns out to be a key factor that benefits the risk-sensitive Aussie. Apart from this, the AUD/USD pair's strong intraday rally could further be attributed to some short-covering ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. The market optimism, however, is likely to be short-lived amid concerns about a deeper global economic downturn. The worries resurfaced after data out of Asia on Friday showed that manufacturing activity in Japan contracted during March, while growth in China stalled during the reported month. Furthermore, fresh speculation that rising energy prices might force the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move back to its inflation-fighting rate hikes, which, in turn, favour the USD bulls might cap the AUD/USD pair. It will be prudent to wait for a strong follow-through buying around the AUD/USD pair before positioning for a further near-term appreciating move. Apart from the RBA meeting, this week's busy US economic docket also features the ADP report on private-sector employment and ISM Services PMI on Wednesday, followed by the crucial US monthly employment report - popularly known as NFP on Friday.

"The USD/JPY pair attracts some sellers after touching over a two-week high on Monday and trades just below the 133.00 round-figure mark during the early North American session. TheUS Dollar(USD) struggles to capitalize on its intraday gains amid the uncertainty over the Fed's rate-hike path, which turns out to be a key factor exerting some downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. The downside, however, seems limited, at least for the time being, amid a generally positive risk tone, which tends to undermine the traditional safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY). From a technical perspective, the USD/JPY pair faces rejection near the 133.75 confluence hurdle, comprising the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the March downfall and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The said area should now act as a pivotal point, which if cleared will set the stage for an extension of the recent move-up witnessed over the past week or so. That said, oscillators on the dailychartare yet to confirm a bullishoutlook, making it prudent to wait for a move beyond the aforementioned barrier before positioning for any further gains. The USD/JPY pair might then aim to surpass the 134.00 round-figure mark and accelerate the momentum towards testing the 61.8% Fibo. level resistance, around the 134.75-134.80 region. On the flip side, any further slide below the 132.80 area, or the 38.2% Fibo. level, is likely to find decent support near the 132.25 region ahead of the 132.00 mark and the 23.6% Fibo. level, around the 131.60-131.55 zone. A convincing break below the latter could drag theUSD/JPYpair below the 131.00 mark, towards the next relevant support near the 130.55-130.50 region.

"The USDJPY experienced fluctuations in today's trading session as market participants reacted to the weekend's oil production cut news. Initially, the JPY was sold, causing the USDJPY to rise. The pair approached the 50% retracement level from the March high to the March low at 133.769, coming within 11 pips of the declining 100-day moving average at 133.879. This level has not been breached since March 10. At this point, buyers turned into sellers, and the price fell back towards the session lows near 132.813. The early US session low reached 132.835, with the current trading price at 132.96. So, what's next? Sellers successfully defended the 50% retracement level and the 100-day moving average, halting the rise and pushing the price lower. Now, as the price is well below the high, the breached 38.2% retracement level of the March trading range at 132.793 appears to be a key support level. If this level is broken, the next significant target would be the 100-hour moving average (blue line in the chart above) at 132.467 (and rising). Market participants can expect buyers to emerge at this level if it is tested.",0
"USD/JPY’s rally is at risk of running out of steam. Year-end foreign bond buying might have fuelled some of this move higher and that is unlikely to be sustained while the scale of the drop in US yields still points to downside USD/JPY risks, economists at MUFG Bank report. JPY weakness may not be sustained “The scale of foreign bond buying in recent weeks ahead of the end of the fiscal year is unlikely to be sustained going forward and hence one feature of support forUSD/JPYmay fade as we move into April. Even if the macro backdrop favours buying it will unlikely be on the same scale.” “In addition, the substantial increase in JPY short positions amongst Leveraged Funds could be a catalyst for a retracement lower in USD/JPY if the move to the upside begins to fade.” “US yields could still grind higher from here but USD/JPY has already jumped by more than implied by short-term yields and hence the influence on lifting USD/JPY further from here is likely to diminish.” ",0
"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will announce its next monetary policy decision on Tuesday, April at 04:30 GMT and as we get closer to the release time, here are the forecasts by the economists and researchers of nine major banks regarding the upcoming central bank's decision. The RBA is set to deliver another 25 basis points rate hike in April, lifting the Official Cash Rate (OCR) from 3.60% to 3.85%. A pause also seems prudent considering the inflation trend and the uncertainty. Rabobank “It remains our view that the RBA will hike by a further 25 bps in April to take the cash rate to 3.85% ahead of a possible pause in May. The softer headline inflation print for February will not be sufficient for the RBA to abandon their tightening bias as labour marketindicators, forward indicators and the still comparatively high level of inflation all point to the need for further tightening.” ANZ “While our central case is for a 25 bps hike in April, the probability of a pause is the highest it’s been in some time. The RBA may take this option to assess the impact of rate hikes so far, given the ‘long and variable’ lags in monetary policy, along with recent global developments. We still see the question as not one of ‘where’ the cash rate peaks at (we still favour 4.1%), but ‘when’.” ING “We believe the RBA will leave the cash rate target unchanged at 3.6%. The RBA hinted at its most recent rate-setting meeting that it was looking at a possible pause inrates, and these inflation numbers provide the perfect excuse. We are reserving judgement on whether this marks the peak for cash rates in this cycle. Other data, including from the labour market, could swing this decision one way or the other. Markets are, however, currently betting that 3.6% marks the peak.” Standard Chartered “We expect the RBA to hike again by 25 bps to 3.85%. That said, the risk of a pause has risen substantially since the last March meeting. With the policy rate at only 3.6%, we may not even get to a real positive real rate by the end of 2023. Hence, we maintain our rate hike call for April.” TDS “We now expect the Bank to pause at the April meeting given the lower Jan-Feb CPI prints and uncertainty over theoutlookfrom the banking turmoil in the near-term.” SocGen “We expect the RBA to hold the cash rate target unchanged at 3.60%. The RBA will likely say that it is appropriate to pause interest rate increases to allow more time to assess the state of the economy, mentioning the recent development in the macroeconomic data and the global economy.” NAB “We think the data justifies another 25 bps hike, but acknowledge it is a line ball decision with the RBA having signalled that they would ‘reconsider’ the case for a pause. The risk is the RBA pauses and retains a hiking bias, preferring to err on the side of a more protracted battle against inflation until or unless its hand is forced by the data. Governor Lowe is speaking on Wednesday, an opportunity to explain the decision.” Citi “For the first time since the beginning of its hiking cycle in May 2022, we expect the RBA to leave the cash rate unchanged. The shift in the view largely stems from softer-than-expected monthly CPI for both January and February. The official quarterly inflation reading will be reported at the end of April, and given the two soft monthly inflation indicator prints, we believe the Bank will now take the option to pause hiking and re-assess the inflation over the next month. However, even with a pause in April, we still expect the Governor’s statement to maintain a tightening bias.” Wells Fargo “Given the recent decline in inflation as well as previous dovish RBA comments, we expect a pause.” ",0

"The EUR/USD pairhas recaptured the round-level resistance of 1.0900 in the early Asian session. The major currency pair showed a V-shape recovery after dropping below 1.0800. The rationale behind the bumper recovery in the shared currency pair was the release of the weak United States ISM Manufacturing PMI data, which conveys that the US growth rate is expected to show a crackdown quarterly. S&P500 settled Monday’s session with marginal gains after a volatile trade as the Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to pause the policy-tightening spell early to avoid a contraction in the growth rate, portraying a risk-on mood. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) reported a vertical fall after a recovery move to near 103.00. The USD Index has reverted to near its weekly low around 102.00 asFedchair Jerome Powell has to prioritize economic conditions before addressing the stubborn inflation. Coming back to the US Manufacturing PMI data, theeconomic datacontracted to 46.3 from the consensus of 47.5 and the former release of 47.7. This was the fifth straight figure below 50.0 and a figure of 50.0 acts as asilverline for a growth contraction. Also, New Orders Index contracted to 44.3 from the expectations of 44.6, which indicates that forward demand is expected to remain subdued. Therefore, the Fed could consider a pause in the policy-tightening spell ahead. On theEurozonefront, rising inflationary pressures led by a shortage of labor are bolstering the need of more rate hikes from theEuropean Central Bank(ECB). And now fresh rise in the oil price along with expectations of more gains have added fuel to the fire. ECB President Christine Lagarde is expected to continue the rate-hiking spell as a rebound in headline Eurozone inflation is highly anticipated. EUR/USD  ",1
"GBP/USD remains firmer around 1.2420 during early Tuesday in Asia as bulls approach the multi-day-old resistance area amid broad US Dollar weakness. In doing so,the Cablepair ignores downbeat inflation forecasts and Brexit concerns at home amid optimistic comments from the Bank of England (BoE) Officials. That said, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) dropped the most in a fortnight the previous day to test the lowest levels in two months as downbeat US data and yields weigh on the Federal Reserve (Fed) bets. On Monday, US ISM Manufacturing PMI dropped to the lowest levels since May 2020 in March, to 46.3 versus 47.5 expected and 47.7 prior. On the same line, the final readings of March’s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI eased to 49.2 compared to 49.3 initial estimations. Softer US PMIs joined the market’s lack of fears from the OPEC+ supply cuts and the resulting Oil price run-up to weigh on the yields. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields printed a four-day downtrend to 3.41% at the latest. With this, the CME’s FedWatch Tool marked nearly 43% market bets on the Fed’s 0.25% rate hike in May, versus 52% expected on Friday. At home,Bank of England(BoE) Chief Economist Huw Pill crossed wires via Reuters while saying, “The UK banking system is well capitalized.” The policymaker also said that the Well-capitalized banks help combat inflation, though inflation is still far too high. Further, the latest monthly survey from Citi and YouGov, published on Monday, said the UK public's inflation expectations eased in March after edging a tad higher in February. ‘For 12 months ahead, the UK public inflation expectations eased to 5.4% in March from 5.6% in February,” states the survey details. It should be noted that No10’s confirmation that the traffic jam at Dover port was due to Brexit and political chaos around grooming gangs prod the GBP/USD buyers. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed mixed while the riskier assets cheered the US Dollar’s weakness. Moving on, a light calendar may allow the Cable pair to remain firmer for the day. However, Wednesday’s US ADP Employment Change, ISM Services PMI and Friday’s USNonfarm Payrolls(NFP) are the keys for the GBP/USD pair traders to watch for clear directions. Technical analysis GBP/USD approaches the 1.2445-50 key resistance area comprising multiple tops marked since early December 2022. It’s worth noting that the RSI (14) conditions are firmer this time, suggesting brighter chances of the quote’s run-up beyond the critical upside hurdle. Meanwhile, the Cable sellers need validation from February’s high of 1.2270. Additional important levels  ",0

"USD/JPY slides to 132.20 while extending the week-start reversal from the highest level in a fortnight. That said, the Yen pair’s latest losses could be linked to the downbeat US Treasury bond yields, as well as softer data, not to forget upbeat comments from Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. After assuring the stability of the financial system at home, Japan PM Kishida pledged more investment to please the Yen pair sellers. “It is necessary to speed up private investment through green transformation bonds to promote decarbonization domestically,” said Japan PM Kishida. Talking about the yields, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields dropped in the last four consecutive days to 3.42% at the latest while the two-year counterpart marked a two-day downtrend in the last to 3.97%. Softer US PMIs joined the market’s lack of inflation fears from the OPEC+ supply cuts and the resulting Oil price run-up to weigh on the yields.

On the same line, the final readings of March’s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI eased to 49.2 compared to 49.3 initial estimations. At home, Japan’s Tankan Large Manufacturing Index for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023, a closely observed output guide by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), eased to 1.0 from 7.0 previous readings and 3.0 expected. On the other hand, Japan’s Jibun Bank Manufacturing PMI for March improved to 49.2 from 48.6 previous. However, the below-50 figure suggests a contraction in private manufacturing activities. It should be noted that the downbeatFedcalls also weigh on the yield and the USD/JPY prices. As per the latest read, the CME’s FedWatch Tool marked nearly 43% market bets on the Fed’s 0.25% rate hike in May, versus 52% expected on Friday. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed mixed and the yields were down while theUS Dollar Index(DXY) dropped the most in a fortnight the previous day to test the lowest levels in two months. Further, the S&P 500 Futures struggle for clear directions. Moving forward, USDJPY may pare recent losses amid a light calendar but downbeat yields and inflation fears, led by the OPEC+ surprise, may weigh on the Yen pair ahead of this week’s key US jobs report, up for publishing on Friday.

Monday'seconomic reportsthat showed US manufacturing activity in March slumped to its lowest level in nearly three years as new orders continued to contract. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that its Manufacturing PMI fell to 46.3 last month. This was the worst since May 2020, from 47.7 in February. Last week’s PCE data, the Federal Reserve´s preferred inflation measure, were mixed.  While headline and core both came in a tick lower than expected, super core accelerated for a second straight month to 4.63% YoY and is the highest since October.  ´´This is not the direction that the Fed desires and so we look for the hawkish tilt in Fed comments to continue,´´ analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman explained. With regards to the Federal Reserve, credit disintermediation is central to the market’s expectation that the FOMC will start cutting interestratesfrom September, analysts at ANZ Bank said. ´´To validate thatoutlook, activity and credit data will need to start weakening precipitously in Q2.

"USD/JPYgrinds near intraday high of around 132.80 during early Tuesday, following the downbeat start of the key week. In doing so, the Yen pair bounces from a convergence of the 100-bar Simple Moving Average (SMA) and one-week-old ascending trend line to reverse the previous day’s losses. Although the Yen pair rebounds from the 132.30 support confluence, bearish MACD signals and the failure to cross the 200-SMA, around 134.00 by the press time, challenge the bulls. Even if the USD/JPY crosses the 134.00 hurdle, a six-week-long horizontal resistance area near 135.10 can restrict the upside moves. It’s worth noting that 135.40 and 136.00 round figures are extra filters towards the north. Should the quote remains firmer past 136.00, the odds of witnessing a fresh Year-To-Date high, currently around 137.90, can’t be ruled out. On the flip side, a clear break of the 132.30 support confluence becomes necessary for the USD/JPY bear’s return. Even so, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the USD/JPY pair’s February-March upside and 50-SMA, near 131.80, can act as the last defense of the buyers. Following that, the 130.00 round figure and the previous monthly low near 129.65 may gain the USD/JPY seller’s attention. Overall, USD/JPY is likely to extend the latest rebound but the recovery moves have limited upside room to cheer. USD/JPY: Four-hour chart  Trend: Pullback expected Additional important levels  ",0
"The GBP/USD pair has attempted a recovery after a marginal correction to near 1.2400 in the Tokyo session.The Cableresisted further correction as hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) bets inspired by upbeat oil prices have receded significantly. All credit goes to weaker-than-anticipatedUnited StatesISM Manufacturing PMI data, which has deepened fears of recession. S&P500 futures have recovered some of the losses registered in the Asian session, indicating a recovery in therisk appetiteof the market participants. TheUS Dollar Index(DXY) is facing barricades in extending its recovery above 102.20 amid an absence of support from the economicindicators. GBP/USD is gradually marching towards the horizontal resistance plotted from December 14 high at 1.2447 on a daily scale. Advancing 10-and 20-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 1.2327 and 1.2257 respectively indicate that the upside momentum is extremely solid. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the bullish range of 60.00-80.00. The momentum oscillator is not showing any sign of divergence or overbought situation, bolstering the upside bias. A decisive move above December 14 high at 1.2447 will expose the asset to the psychological resistance at 1.2500 followed by June 08 high around 1.2600. In an alternate scenario, a break below March 23 low at 1.2261 will accelerate the downside in the Cable toward the round-level support at 1.2200 and March 10 high at 1.2113.

"EUR/USD makes rounds to 1.0890-85 as the bulls take a breather amid a light calendar, as well as mildly offbeat sentiment, during early Tuesday. The Euro pair’s latest retreat could also be linked to the rebound in the US Treasury bond yields, which in turn allow the US Dollar to pare the week-start fall ahead of second-tier data. US Dollar Index(DXY) prints mild gains around 102.20 after falling the most since March 22 the previous day. With this, the greenback’s gauge versus the six major currencies rebound from the one-week low. That said, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields lick their wounds around 3.42% and 3.98% after printing a four-day and two-day downtrend in that order. Apart from the corrective bounce in yields, mixed concerns about the inflation and geopolitical woes surrounding Russia and China also weighed on the EUR/USD price. That said, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies led by Russia, known as OPEC+, announced a surprise output cut on Monday and renewed inflation fears. However, US President Joe Biden shrugged off the OPEC+ move and said that it is not as bad as you think. However, US Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, as well as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen flagged fears of higher inflation and challenges to global growth. Elsewhere, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov raised fears of escalating Moscow-Brussels tussle by saying, “The European Union (EU) has ""lost"" Russia.” The policymaker also added that Moscow will deal with Europe in a tough fashion if need be. Furthermore, the US-China tension is also on the table as Beijing keeps reiterating its dislike for the US-Taiwan ties but Washington seems to ignore it.

"Following are the key headlines from theReserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) April monetary policy statement, via Reuters, as presented by Governor Phillip Lowe. Expects that some further tightening of monetary policy may well be needed. Board recognises that monetary policy operates with a lag and that the full effect of this substantial increase in interest rates is yet to be felt. Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that. Board took the decision to hold interest rates steady this month to provide additional time to assess the impact of the increase in interest rates to date and the economic outlook. Path to achieving a soft landing remains a narrow one. Australian banking system is strong, well capitalised and highly liquid. Wages growth is continuing to increase in response to the tight labour market and higher inflation. Board remains alert to the risk of a prices-wages spiral. Inflation has peaked in australia, goods price inflation is expected to moderate over the months ahead. Labour market remains very tight. As economic growth slows, unemployment is expected to increase. Growth in the australian economy has slowed. AUD/USD drops below 0.6770 as RBA keeps policy unchanged About RBA rate decision RBAInterest Rate Decisionis announced by theReserve Bank of Australia. If the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and rises the interest rates it is positive, or bullish, for the AUD. Likewise, if the RBA has a dovish view on the Australian economy and keeps the ongoing interest rate, or cuts the interest rate it is seen as negative, or bearish.",1

RBAGovernor Philip Lowehas kept the Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 3.6%.  The street was divided over the interest rate decision as Australia’s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicator has already conveyed that inflation has softened quickly in the past two months to 6.8% from the peak of 8.4% registered in December. It seems that RBA Governor Philip Lowe is highly optimistic about further softening in Australian inflation. On Monday, the Australian Dollar remained in action after the release of the downbeat Caixin Manufacturing PMI data. Theeconomic datahas landed at 50.0, lower than the consensus of 51.7 and the former release of 51.5. The Chinese economy is struggling in reviving growth despite dismantling pandemic controls and favoring monetary and non-monetary measures. It is worth noting that Australia is the leading trading partner of China and weak manufacturing activities have a severe impact on the Australian Dollar. Meanwhile, theUS Dollar Index(DXY) is facing barricades after a recovery move to near 102.20. The upside in the USD Index looks capped as investors are anticipating an early pause in the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policy-tightening spell. Deepening fears of a recession in the United States economy led by five straight ISM Manufacturing PMI contractions are advocating for a pause in the restrictive monetary policy regime. This week, the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment Change (March) data will be keenly watched, which is scheduled for Wednesday.

"In the opinion of UOB Group’s Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang and Senior FX Strategist Peter Chia,GBP/USDneeds to clear the 1.2450 region to allow for extra gains in the near term. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “The sharp snap back that sent GBP soaring to a high of 1.2424 yesterday came as a surprise (we were expecting GBP to drop further). While GBP could continue to rise and break above 1.2450, overbought conditions suggest it might not be able to hold above this level, and the next resistance at 1.2500 is unlikely to come under threat. On the downside, a break of 1.2365 (minor support is at 1.2390) would indicate that GBP is not strengthening further.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (03 Apr, spot at 1.2310), we held the view that GBP ‘is not strengthening further’ and we expected it to trade in a range of 1.2190/1.2380. We did not anticipate the sharp bounce that sent GBP soaring above 1.2380 (high has been 1.2424). Upward momentum is building again but GBP has to break clearly above the major resistance at 1.2450 before a sustained rise is likely. The chances of a clear break of 1.2450 will remain intact as long as GBP stays above 1.2330 in the next few days. Looking ahead, the next resistance level above 1.2450 is at 1.2550.”",1
"AUD/USD takes offers to renew intraday low near 0.6755 as it stretches the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) induced losses amid the early hours of Tuesday’s European session. In doing so, the Aussie pair justifies the central bank’s dovish play, as well as takes clues from the downbeat sentiment and a corrective bounce of the US Dollar. After 10 consecutive rate increases, the RBA announced the status quo of its current monetary policy with the benchmark rate being 3.60% at the latest. In doing so, the Australian central bank justifies the recent downside of Australian inflation and Retail Sales data while also saying, “Board expects that some further tightening of monetary policy may well be needed.” On the other hand, the US Dollar Index (DXY) prints mild gains around 102.20 after falling the most since March 22 on Monday. The DXY’s latest rebound could be linked to the pause in the benchmark US Treasury bond yields’ previous fall. That said, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields lick their wounds around 3.42% and 3.98% after printing a four-day and two-day downtrend in that order. Apart from the RBA moves and US Dollar’s rebound, risks emanating from China and Russia also exert downside pressure on the AUD/USD price due to the pair’s risk barometer status. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov raised fears of escalating Moscow-Brussels tussle by saying, “The European Union (EU) has ""lost"" Russia.” The policymaker also added that Moscow will deal with Europe in a tough fashion if need be. That said, China’s Consulate General in Los Angeles spokesperson conveyed their dislike for a meeting between Taiwan PresidentTsai Ing-wenand US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on early Tuesday. Additionally teasing AUD/USD sellers are mixed concerns about the OPEC+ move’s impact on inflation and the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) next action as hawkish bets recede. Late on Monday, US President Joe Biden shrugged off the OPEC+ move and said that it is not as bad as you think. However, US Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, as well as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen flagged fears of higher inflation and challenges to global growth. While portraying the market’s bets on the Fed, the CME’s FedWatch Tool marks nearly 42% market bets on the Fed’s 0.25% rate hike in May, versus 52% flashed on Friday. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures pause a four-day uptrend near the highest levels since February 16 but remain sluggish while depicting the market’s mood. Looking forward, US Factory Orders for February, expected -0.5% versus -1.6% prior, may entertain intraday AUD/USD traders ahead of Wednesday’s speech from RBAGovernor Philip Lowe. Should Governor Lowe resist accepting the dovish bias, the Aussie pair may witness a corrective bounce. Technical analysis AUD/USD bears remain hopeful unless the quote stays below a convergence of the 200-day EMA and an upward-sloping resistance line from mid-March, around 0.6820 by the press time. Even so, a daily closing below the 100-day EMA level of 0.6770 becomes necessary for the Aussie pair to suggest the quote’s further downside. Additional important levels  ",0

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected USD to trade between 132.55 and 133.55 yesterday. However, USD traded in a wider range than expected (132.19/133.75).

Today, USD is likely to trade in a range of 131.90/133.40.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our latest narrative was from last Thursday (30 Mar, spot at 132.60) wherein the rebound in USD could extend to 134.20 but a sustained rise above this level is unlikely. Yesterday (03 Apr), USD rose briefly to 133.75 before retreating sharply. Upward momentum is beginning to slow and the chances of 134.20 coming into view are diminishing.

However, the Aussie is unlikely to weaken significantly as the end of the rate hike cycle might not yet have been reached, economists at Commerzbank report. RBA not excluding further rate hikes “RBA left its key rate unchanged at 3.6%. After the RBA hiked its key rate by a total of 3.5 percentage points over the past quarters it now sees scope to wait for the effects of monetary policy tightening so far. On the other hand, it remained concerned that it might see a wage-price spiral and confirmed that it would pay close attention to the evolution of labour costs and the price setting behaviour of firms. It thus signalled that the end of the rate hike cycle might not yet have been reached.” “In an initial reaction, AUD eased slightly as there had been some market participants who had expected a rate hike. However, as the statement sounds quite hawkish, with theRBAnot excluding further rate hikes, the negative effect on the AUD is likely to be limited.

a squeeze. GBPUSD Technical Analysis On the 4 hour chart below, we can
see that the price did a fakeout when it broke below thetrendline. This is arising

are in favour of the sellers here. When the price breaks the wedge, it
generally falls all the way back to the bottom of the pattern, which in this
case is at the 1.20 handle. Nevertheless, the price rallied strongly yesterday
back to the top, even after the very weak ISM Manufacturing PMI. On the 1 hour chart below, we can
see more closely the very strong rally that started at the open of the European
Session. This looks like a squeeze on dollar longs, but we may need to wait for
the next economic data like theISM Services PMItomorrow to see how it all
evolves. The sellers are likely to pile in both at the top of the range and at

ECB hawks still pushing for a 50 bps hike in May “ECB hawks such as Austria's Robert Holzmann suggested that a 50 bps ECB hike was 'still in the cards for May'. That would seem unlikely (a 22 bps hike is currently priced), but serves as a reminder that the ECB lags theFedin its tightening cycle and that the ECB will be a lot slower to ease policy.” “Overall, we suspect that the market will be reluctant to chase EUR/USD above 1.10 yet given concerns about the regional US banking system.

"After having suffered heavy losses against its major rivals on Monday and Tuesday, the US Dollar (USD) has staged a rebound early Wednesday. Although the US Dollar Index (DXY) edged lower with the initial reaction to the disappointing macroeconomic data releases from the US, it didn't have a difficult time holding its ground. Renewed concerns over a slowdown in the US economy caused Wall Street's main indexes to open in negative territory and helped USD find demand as a safe haven. Meanwhile, the CME Group FedWatch Tool shows that there is a stronger-than-60% probability of the US Federal Reserve leaving its policy rate unchanged at the May policy meeting. Daily digest market movers: US Dollar finds a foothold amid risk aversion Technical analysis: US Dollar struggles to outperfrom Euro EUR/USDhas staged a technical correction but managed to hold above 1.0900 on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the daily chart stays above 60 and the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) continues to move away from the 50-day SMA following the bullish cross earlier this week, reflecting the bullish bias. OnceEUR/USDclears the 1.0950/1.0960 resistance area and confirms it as support, it could target 1.1000 (end-point of the latest uptrend, psychological level) and 1.1035 (multi-month high set in early February). On the downside, 1.0800/1.0780 (psychological level, static level, 20-day SMA) aligns as first important support area before 1.0730 (50-day SMA) and 1.0670 (100-day SMA). How does Fed’s policy impact US Dollar? The US Federal Reserve (Fed) has two mandates: maximum employment and price stability. The Fed uses interest rates as the primary tool to reach its goals but has to find the right balance. If the Fed is concerned about inflation, it tightens its policy by raising the interest rate to increase the cost of borrowing and encourage saving. In that scenario, the US Dollar (USD) is likely to gain value due to decreasing money supply. On the other hand, the Fed could decide to loosen its policy via rate cuts if it’s concerned about a rising unemployment rate due to a slowdown in economic activity. Lower interest rates are likely to lead to a growth in investment and allow companies to hire more people. In that case, the USD is expected to lose value. TheFedalso uses quantitative tightening (QT) or quantitative easing (QE) to adjust the size of its balance sheet and steer the economy in the desired direction. QE refers to the Fed buying assets, such as government bonds, in the open market to spur growth and QT is exactly the opposite. QE is widely seen as a USD-negative central bank policy action and vice versa.",0
"The Australian Dollar weakened modestly further in March. Economists at MUFG Bank see upside scope but tempered by bouts ofrisk aversion. RBA unlikely to cut rates this year “With China re-opening likely to provide support for growth this year, we do not expect theRBAto cut rates this year.” “AUD/USD should be set for a move higher through the rest of the year although periods to risk aversion will see AUD suffer more, which will slow the move higher.” “AUD/USD: Q2 2023 0.6800 Q3 2023 0.7000 Q4 2023 0.7200 Q1 2024 0.7100.” ",0
"GBP/USDgains accelerate through key resistance at 1.2445. This is a strong bullish signal for the GBP, economists at Scotiabank report. A major bull move in the Pound is developing “Gains in the GBP through the mid-1.24 area that has capped the Pound since last year are a bullish technical signal that augurs for more strength ahead.” “Assuming there is no quick reversal of the breakout, the move implies upside potential in Cable towards 1.30 over the next 3-6 months.” “Solid-looking bull trend signals on the short, medium and long-term DMI oscillators lend a lot of credence to the idea that a major bull move in the Pound is developing here.” ",1
"EUR/USDextends gains through the low 1.09 area. Economists at Scotiabank expect the pair to retest the early 2023 peak at 1.1030. Sustained bull trend “The technical set up here – sequential higher highs and higher lows on the short-term charts and solid bull trend momentum on the intraday, daily and weekly oscillators – points to a sustained bull trend which should make progress towards a retest of the early 2023 peak at 1.1030 – and perhaps more.” “While ECB comments on rate prospects have become a bit more nuanced (aside from Holzmann’s comments yesterday that a 50 bps hike was still on the cards), there has been enough concern expressed by policymakers about rising core inflation to keep a half-point move as a risk for the May policy decision (even if markets are pricing more along the lines of +25 bps).” ",1
"Economists at Credit Suisse look forEUR/USDto push towards 1.1250. EUR still being carried by the ECB “At the start of Q1 we wrote ‘a hawkish ECB framework, lower energy prices in Europe and a market fixation with US disinflation potential all leave room forEUR/USDto push again towards 1.0950 near-term.’ With that framework intact/strengthened post US bank failures in March and a stubborn ECB, we expect an extension now to 1.1250.” “The key view risk is that banking stress spills over into Europe or that political tensions exacerbate, though the 1.0500 level should be strong support.” ",1

Additionally, oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Rate of Change (RoC) justified the case for higher prices. RSI is still in bullish territory, with space before turning overbought. For a bullish continuation, the GBP/USD must achieve a daily close above 1.2500 to test the newly hit YTD high at 1.2525.

""We expect the Swiss franc to remain resilient, supported by the SNB's strategy to use currency strength as a lever against inflation.

""We do not expect the recent banking sector stress to dent franc strength or undermine its status as one of the world's 'safe haven' currencies.

In doing so, the Australian central bank justifies the recent downside of Australian inflation and Retail Sales data while also saying, “Board expects that some further tightening of monetary policy may well be needed.” Risk-on mood joinsnewssuggesting recent challenges to the US Dollar’s reserve currency status appear to weigh on the greenback. Bloomberg released a news report suggesting the US Dollar’s less acceptance as a reserve currency in Russia while highlighting the greenback’s latest weakness. “Chinese Yuan has surpassed the US Dollar as the most traded currency, in monthly trading volume, for the first time in Russia in February,” said the news while also adding that the gap has continued to widen in March. In the last week, Brazil and China agreed to pause the US Dollar’s usage as an intermediary in trade transactions. Alternatively, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov raised fears of escalating Moscow-Brussels tussle by saying, “The European Union (EU) has ""lost"" Russia.” The policymaker also added that Moscow will deal with Europe in a tough fashion if need be.

"TheEUR/USD pairis displaying a sideways action after an upside move above 1.0970 in the early Asian session. The shared currency pair is expected to continue its lackluster move as investors are awaiting the release of the United States Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment and ISM Services PMI data. S&P500 ended Tuesday’s gains with decent losses as investors turned cautious ahead of US economic reports, portraying a drop in therisk appetiteof the market participants. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has refreshed its monthly low near 101.46 as investors are anticipating the maintenance of status-quo by the Federal Reserve (Fed) for its May monetary policy meeting. As per the CME Fedwatch tool, chances for an unchanged interest rate decision stand near 60%. The Fed is required to shift its focus towards contracting manufacturing activities to safeguard the United States economy from falling into recession. The release of theUS economic dataon Wednesday would provide more clarity. According to the consensus, the US economy has added fresh 200K jobs in March than the former additions of 242K. Hopes for one more rate hike from theFedcould be propelled if the US labor market continues to remain tight. However, the release of weak Job Openings data on Tuesday indicates that the labor market is cooling now. Data released on Tuesday indicates lower talent acquisition requests at 9.9 million, compared to 10.5 million in January and 10.4 million as expected by the market participants. In addition to US Employment data, US ISM Services PMI will also keep investors busy. The US ISM Services PMI (Mar) is expected to contract to 54.5 from the former release of 55.1. Also, New Orders Index that reflects forward-demand would drop to 57.6 from the prior release of 62.6.

It’s worth noting, however, that the RSI (14) line is near the overbought territory and suggests a pullback in the GBP/USD prices before mark the next leg towards the north. Also teasing the Cable pair sellers is the existence of a one-month-old rising wedge bearish chart pattern, currently between 1.2550 and 1.2390. Should the quote drops below 1.2390, it confirms the bearish formation and can refresh the 2023 bottom, around 1.1800 by the press time. However, a convergence of the 50-DMA and the 100-DMA, close to 1.2155-50 acts as an important support to watch during the anticipated fall. On the flip side, a clear upside break of the 1.2550 hurdle, comprising the stated wedge’s top line, defies the bearish chart pattern and can propel the GBP/USD prices toward the May 2022 high of around 1.2665. That said, the 1.2600 round figure and September 2020 low near 1.2675 act as extra upside filters for the Cable pair buyers to watch during the quote’s further upside.

"USD/JPY takes offers to refresh the intraday low near 131.40 as Tokyo opens on Wednesday. In doing so, the yen pair drops for the third consecutive day after reversing from the 100-DMA during the last week. Not only the U-turn from the 100-DMA but a following downturn past convergence of the 50-DMA and 23.6%Fibonacciretracement level of its October 2022 to January 2023 fall, around 133.05 at the latest, also keep USD/JPY bears hopeful. Adding strength to the downside bias is the steady RSI (14) and sluggish MACD signals. However, the RSI level is below the 50 mark and hence suggests the dip-buying, which in turn highlights an upward-sloping support line from January 16, close to 130.70 at the key level to watch for the USD/JPY bears. Should the quote drop below 130.70, the odds of witnessing a break of the 13.0.00 psychological magnet can’t be ruled out. Alternatively, the aforementioned resistance confluence of around 133.05, comprising 50-DMA and 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, restricts short-term advances of the USD/JPY pair. Following that, the 100-DMA and a downward-sloping trend line from late October 2022, respectively near 133.65 and 135.00 in that order, could challenge the Yen pair buyers. It’s worth noting, however, that the USD/JPY run-up beyond 135.00 won’t hesitate to challenge the Year-To-Date (YTD) high surrounding 137.90.

"AUD/USD extends late Tuesday’s rebound from the 200-DMA while refreshing intraday high near 0.6770 amid Wednesday’s mid-Asian session. In doing so, the Aussie pair consolidates the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) induced losses ahead of RBA Governor Philip Lowe’s speech. It’s worth noting, however, that the mixed Aussie PMIs for March seem to fail in stopping the quote’s latest recovery moves. That said, Australia’s AiG Construction PMI for January dropped to -5.8 from -5.0 but the Manufacturing counterpart for the said month improved to 5.6 from -6.4 in previous readings. Further, S&P Global Services PMI for March rose to 50.7 from 48.2 while the S&P Global Composite PMI also improved to 48.5 versus 48.1 prior readings. While tracing the Aussie pair’s latest run-up, the previous day’sRBARate Statement gains major attention as it said, “Board expects that some further tightening of monetary policy may well be needed.” Additionally favoring AUD/USD bulls is the broad US Dollar weakness amid cautious optimism in the market and the latest challenges to the greenback’s reserve currency status, mainly emanating from Russia, China and Brazil. Furthermore, the recent declines in the hawkish Fed bets, despite the upbeat comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials, also allow the quote to remain firmer.Federal Reserve Bankof Cleveland leader Loretta Mester recently cited the need to hike rates above 5% and hold them there for a while. While portraying the mood, Wall Street closed with minor losses but the US Treasury bond yields remain depressed with the benchmark 10-year coupons holding lower grounds near 3.34% after falling in the last five consecutive days. It should be observed that the CME’s FedWatch Tool suggests almost even chances of the US central bank’s 0.25% rate hike in May. Moving on, RBA’s Lowe needs to strike a strong hawkish message to defend the latest gains. Following that, US ISM Services PMI and ADP Employment Change for March will be in focus. It’s worth mentioning that the yields are crucial to watch as their fall has recently weighed on the greenback and allowed the AUD/USD price to remain firmer. Technical analysis Successful trading beyond the 200-DMA, around 0.6750 by the press time, directs AUD/USD bulls toward a confluence of the 50-DMA and 100-DMA, close to 0.6805 at the latest.

"AUD/USD grinds near an intraday high surrounding 0.6770 as it pares the previous day’s losses after upbeat comments from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)Governor Philip Loweearly Wednesday. The Aussie pair dropped the most in a week the previous day as the Aussie central bank paused a 10-time rate hike trajectory. However, RBA’s Lowe shows the readiness to resume the rate lifts while pushing back the doves and allowing the quote to remain firmer. “Decision to hold rates steady does not imply interest rate rises are over,” said the policymaker. Also read:RBA’s Lowe: Decision to hold rates steady does not imply interest rate rises are over It should be noted that the early-day releases of mixed Aussie PMIs and the latest corrective moves in the US Treasury bond yields and the US Dollar Index (DXY) seem to challenge the Aussie pair buyers ahead of the key US data. On the same line could be the hawkish comments fromFederal Reserve Bankof Cleveland leader Loretta Mester.

Further, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields also take a breather around 3.35% and 3.85% respectively, after falling in the last four and three consecutive days. Having witnessed the initial reaction to RBA Governor Lowe’s speech, as well as mixed Aussie data, AUD/USD pair traders should focus on the US ISM Services PMI and ADP Employment Change for March for clear directions.

"EUR/USD remains mildly bid around 1.0960-65 as it portrays a three-day uptrend during early Wednesday in Europe. In doing so,the Europair justifies the latest growth optimism from Germany and Eurozone while also portraying the cautious mood ahead of the key US activity and employment numbers for March. On Tuesday, Reuters cited sources who have seen the so-called Joint Economic Forecasts, to be presented in Berlin today, to mention that the German economy is likely to narrowly skirt recession and post modest growth in the first quarter of the year. On the same line could be the ECB monthly survey of consumer expectations that suggested an easing in inflation and improvement in growth, as well as an easing in the unemployment rate, for the next 12 months. Not only the upbeat signal for the old continent but downbeat US data and the greenback’s less acceptance among the key global trade players seem to keep the EUR/USD pair buyers hopeful. That said, US JOLTS Job Openings for February gained major attention the previous day as it dropped to the lowest levels since May 2021 while flashing a 9.931M figure for February versus 10.4M expected and 10.563M revised prior. On the same line, US Factory Orders for February came in -0.7% MoM versus -0.5% expected and downwardly revised -2.1% prior. On the other hand, Eurozone Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 0.5% MoM and 13.2% YoY in February, versus -2.8% and 15.1% respectively priors. That said, Germany’s Trade Balance also remained static near €16B during the stated month versus market forecasts of €17B. Elsewhere, Bloomberg released anewsreport suggesting the US Dollar’s less acceptance in Russia. “Chinese Yuan has surpassed the US Dollar as the most traded currency, in monthly trading volume, for the first time in Russia in February,” said the news while also adding that the gap has continued to widen in March. In the last week, Brazil and China agreed to pause the US Dollar’s usage as an intermediary in trade transactions. Alternatively, the latest comments fromFederal Reserve Bankof Cleveland leader Loretta Mester join the market’s pre-data anxiety to prod the EUR/USD bulls. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 Futures print mild gains even as Wall Street closed with minor losses. Further, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields also take a breather around 3.35% and 3.85% respectively, after falling in the last four and three consecutive days. It’s worth mentioning that the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped to the lowest levels in five weeks earlier in the day before bouncing off the 101.43 level, around 101.54 by the press time. Looking forward, EUR/USD traders should pay attention to the final readings of the Germany and Eurozone PMIs for intermediate directions ahead of the US ISM Services PMI and ADP Employment Change for March. Given the recently mixed concerns and the hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) comments, upbeat figures of the scheduled US data can tease the EUR/USD sellers.

"EUR/USDis continuously trading sideways around 1.0960 following the footprints of the US Dollar Index (DXY). The major currency pair is struggling to find a decisive move as investors are likely to show interest after the release of theUnited StatesAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment and ISM Services PMI data. S&P500 futures have turned negative after some minimal gains in the Asian session, portraying a further decline in therisk appetiteof the market participants. USequitieswitnessed selling pressure on Tuesday as the release of the downbeat US Job Openings data after declining Manufacturing activities triggered the risk of recession. Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has shown a modest recovery after refreshing its monthly low at 101.45 being supported by firmer US Treasury yields. The demand for US government bonds has turned subdued despite the rising chances of a steady monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The 10-year US Treasury yields have rebounded to near 3.35%. Cooling US labor market supports a steady Federal Reserve policy One major reason that has been driving US interest rates higher for the past year and keeping inflationary pressures stubborn is the tight labor market. Shortage of labor was loading households withstellarfunds, which was keeping the retail demand upbeat and prices of goods and services were not coming down. On Tuesday, the US Job Openings data displayed the economic data for demand for labor below 10 million for the first time since 2021. This allowed the contracting US Manufacturing sector to join hands with the declining demand for labor and conveyed the message of cooling the US labor market due to a bleakeconomic outlook. Back-to-back weak economic data is deepening fears of a recession in the US economy. Therefore the street is anticipating an early pause to the policy-tightening spell by the Federal Reserve. As per the CME Fedwatch tool, investors are advocating an unchanged interest rate decision for May’s monetary policy meeting. The release of the US ADP Employment data would provide significant guidance about the condition of the US labor market. As per the consensus, the US economy has made fresh additions of 200K jobs in March versus. 242K jobs added in February. Also, the release of the US ISM Services PMI data will provide major clarity. The US Manufacturing sector has been contracting for the past five months as a figure below 50.0 is considered a contraction. And, contraction in the services sector would stem anticipation of contracting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on a quarterly basis. The US ISM Services PMI (Mar) is expected to contract to 54.5 from the former release of 55.1. Also, New Orders Index that reflects forward-demand would drop to 57.6 from the prior release of 62.6. Eurozone annual inflation expectations soften to 4.6% In Eurozone, the survey of consumer expectations for inflation, conducted by theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) on a monthly basis showed that median inflation expectations for the next 12 months have fallen to 4.6% in February vs. 4.9% recorded in January. Constantly rising rates by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to tame sticky Eurozone inflation has trimmed consumer inflation expectations. However, the economic data is ex-discounted of the recent jump in oil prices, which carries the potential of spurting global inflation. The Eurozone economy is highly dependent on the import of oil, which could result in a rebound in the inflation pressures and could put the shared continent back to square. Apart from that, expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative, and expectations for the unemployment rate in 12 months have decreased.

"TheGBP/USDpair is seen oscillating in a narrow trading band through the early part of the European session on Wednesday and consolidates its recent gains to its highest level since June 2022 touched the previous day. The pair is currently placed around the 1.2500 psychological mark and seems poised to prolong the upward trajectory witnessed over the past month or so. A modest intraday uptick in the US Treasury bond yields, along with a mildly softer risk tone, assist the safe-haven US Dollar to stall its recent downfall to over a two-month low, which, in turn, acts as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. The USD, however, struggles to gain any meaningful traction amid firming expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is nearly done with its tightening cycle. In fact, the current market pricing indicates an even chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the May FOMC meeting and the possibility of rate cuts by end-December. The bets were reaffirmed by the weaker US macro data on Tuesday, which showed that job openings in February dropped to the lowest in nearly two years and Factory Orders declined for the second straight month. The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report,  was seen as a sign that the Fed's efforts to slow the labor market may be having some impact. This, in turn, should keep a lid on any meaningful upside for the US bond yields and hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. The aforementioned factors, to a larger extent, helps offset mixed signals from the Bank of England (BoE) policymakers over the future rate-hike path. In fact, the BoE MPC member Silvana Tenreyro on Tuesday advocated for consideration of cutting rates sooner than thought as the absence of cost-push shocks would bring down inflation well below targets. In contrast, the BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said that action is still needed in assessing inflation prospects and that the onus remains on ensuring enough policy tightening is delivered to see the job through. The lack of any meaningful selling, meanwhile, suggests that the path of least resistance for the GBP/USD pair is to the upside. Bullish traders, however, seem reluctant to place fresh bets and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the closely-watched US monthly jobs data - popularly known as theNFPreport - on Friday.

"The USD/JPY pair extends this week's rejection slide from the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and remains under some selling pressure for the third successive day on Wednesday. The downward trajectory drags spot prices to a one-week low, around the 131.25-131.20 region during the first half of the European session. A mildly softer tone around the equity markets benefits the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and is seen as a key factor exerting downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. That said, a modest US Dollar (USD) bounce from over a two-month low, helped by an uptick in the US Treasury bond yields, lends some support and limits the downside for the major, at least for the time being. The fundamental backdrop, however, still seems tilted in favour of bearish traders, suggesting that any attempted recovery move is more likely to get sold into. Investors now seem convinced that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is nearly done with its tightening cycle and have been pricing in an even chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the May FOMC meeting. Furthermore, market participants see the possibility of rate cuts by end-December and the bets were reaffirmed by the weaker US macro data on Tuesday, showing that job openings in February dropped to the lowest in nearly two years. This seems to act as a headwind for the US bond yields and is holding back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets.

If it did not even fight the massive rise in energy prices like other central banks and did not use the opportunity of an overall inflation rate well in excess of 2% to change its approach, how likely is it that it will change its monetary policy ‘only’ because the core rate remains elevated?” “How difficult will communication become if the best argument, that is an inflation rate well above target, is already weakened? Of course, that leaves core inflation as an argument, but a sudden focus on this argument would not seem that convincing to me either.

"Economists at Barclays expect the Swiss Franc to remain resilient. They see the EUR/CHF pair hovering around parity for an extended period. Recent banking sector stress unlikely to dent Franc strength or undermine its “safe haven” status “We expect the Swiss Franc to remain resilient, supported by the SNB’s strategy to use currency strength as a lever against inflation. This strategy is implemented via further policy rate hikes and FX intervention, which should keep EUR/CHF around parity for an extended period. In a recovering EUR environment, this implies additional strength versus the Dollar (to below 0.90 in USD/CHF).” “We do not expect the recent banking sector stress to dent Franc strength or undermine its status as one of the world’s ‘safe haven’ currencies. Such an outcome would require radical shifts in Switzerland’s balance sheet via ‘safe asset’ outflows, which we deem very unlikely.” ",0

"The AUD/USD pair comes under heavy selling pressure on Wednesday and extends the previous day's retracement slide from the vicinity of the 0.6800 mark, or its highest level since February 24. Spot prices, however, manage to recover a few pips from the daily low and trade around the 0.6700 round figure during the early North American session. The Australian Dollar continues to be weighed down by the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) dovish outlook, which, along with a modest US Dollar (USD) rebound from over a two-month low, drag the AUD/USD pair lower for the second straight day. It is worth recalling that the Australian central bank on Tuesday paused its rate-hiking cycle following 10 consecutive raises and signalled that inflation had likely peaked. In the accompanying policy statement, the RBA noted that it wanted additional time to assess the full effects of rate increases as the economy slows. The USD, on the other hand, draws some support from an intraday uptick in the US Treasury bond yields, though lacks bullish conviction amid expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is nearly done with its tightening cycle. In fact, the current market pricing indicates an even chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the May FOMC meeting and the possibility of rate cuts by end-December. The bets were reaffirmed by the disappointing release of the US ADP report, showing that private-sector employers added 145K jobs in March, down sharply from the 261K in the previous month. This comes on the back of the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, which indicated that job openings in February dropped to the lowest in nearly two years. This is seen as a sign that the Fed's efforts to slow the labor market may be having some impact. Apart from this, looming recession risks reinforce speculations that theFedmight soon pause its inflation-fighting rate hikes, which caps the upside for the US bond yields. This, in turn, is holding back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and lending some support to the AUD/USD pair. Moving ahead, traders now look to the release of the US ISM Services PMI for a fresh impetus. The focus, however, will remain on the closely-watched US monthly employment details, popularly known as theNFPreport, on Friday. Nevertheless, the aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before positioning for any meaningful corrective downfall for the AUD/USD pair.

US yields accelerated the decline after the ADP report, boosting the Japanese Yen across the board. The US 10-year yield fell to 3.30%, and is about to test March lows. The 2-year Treasury yield was at 3.89% and bottomed at 3.75%. The US Dollar Index erased daily gains and fell from 101.70 to 101.50. On Tuesday, the DXY posted the lowest daily close since early February. The USD/JPY bottomed at 130.97, hitting the lowest level since March 29. As of writing, it is testing the 131.00 zone.

EUR/USD: Initial resistance appears in the 1.0970/80 band EUR/USD keeps the cautious note and exchanges ups & downs in the 1.0950 region amidst the equally inconclusive price action around the greenback on Wednesday. Earlier hawkish comments from ECB policy makers (Vasle, Vujcic) lend some support to the single currency along with healthy prints from Services PMIs in the euro area, although the generalized steady prudence ahead of theNFP figureson Friday appears to keep bulls contained for the time being. In US data space, the ADP Employment Report showed the US private sector created 145K jobs in March vs. 200K expected and down from February’s 261K jobs. Additionally, the US trade deficit widened to $70.5B in February and the final Services PMI improved to 52.6 during last month. Finally, the ISM Non-Manufacturing is expected later in the session. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD keeps the weekly rally well and sound despite the ongoing knee-jerk, allowing for a potential test of the key 1.1000 mark sooner rather than later. In the meantime, price action around the single currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the incipient Fed-ECB divergence when it comes to the banks’ intentions regarding the potential next moves in interest rates.

"AUD/USD is trading at 0.6720 and has been stuck in a range of between 0.6676 and 0.6779 so far. The US Dollar has been firmer on Wednesday, recovering from two-month lows as investors lightened their short positions ahead of Friday´s US Nonfarm Payrolls and the Easter holidays. The Greenback was initially offered at 101.415, DXY, after a second-straight report showed slowing employment growth in theUnited States. The combination of this week´s data and a report today that showed US private sector employers added 145,000 jobs in March, well under expectations for a rise of 210,000 is casting a dark cloud over the US Dollar. The ADP National Employment report showed US private employers hired fewer workers than expected in March, suggesting a cooling labor market. Private employment increased by 145,000 jobs last month, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast private employment increasing by 200,000. The services industry was also shown to have slowed more than expected in March as the measure of prices paid by services businesses fell to the lowest in nearly three years. The ISM's Non-Manufacturing index dropped to 51.2 in March from 55.1 in February. The services sector's employment indicator sliding as well to 45.8 from 47.6 in February. This data falls ahead of Friday´s US Nonfarm Payrolls report whereby traders who are in on Good Friday will be looking for any confirmation that the labor market is cooling, a major requisite in the Federal Reserve's fight to curb inflation. Particular attention will be paid to the Unemployment Rate in this regard. Analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman said the following with regard to the forthcoming jobs data: ´´The consensus for Nonfarm Payrolls this Friday stands at 240k vs. 311k in February, while the unemployment rate is seen steady at 3.6%.  Average hourly earnings are expected to slow to 4.3% y/y vs. 4.6% in February.  It's worth noting that the data will come on Good Friday.  With markets likely to be very thin, we could get some outsize movements from the numbers, whether good or bad. ´´ Meanwhile, the analysts at BBH noted that Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a known hawk, said monetary policy needs to move “somewhat further into restrictive territory this year, with the fed funds rate moving above 5% and the real fed funds rate staying in positive territory for some time.”  She added that she was “very comfortable” with the Fed’s decision to hike rates 25 bp last month and that “So far that seems to have stabilized at the moment.” ´´Yet Fed tightening expectations continue to fall,´´ the analysts said. ´´WIRP suggests around 55% odds of 25 bp hike at the May 2-3 meeting.  After that, it’s all about the cuts; 2-3 cuts by year-end are priced in.  In that regard, Powell said that Fed officials “just don’t see” any rate cuts this year. ´´ The analysts also pointed put that last week’s PCE data were mixed.  ´´While headline and core both came in a tick lower than expected, super core accelerated for a second straight month to 4.63% y/y and is the highest since October.  This is not the direction that the Fed desires and so we look for the hawkish tilt inFedcomments to continue,´´ the analysts argued. AUD could have last laugh For the Aussie, MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said in a note that while the expectations are that the Reserve Bank of Australia,RBA, is close to or has ended its rate-rise cycle, negative for AUD, ´´it's partially offset by bets other G10 central banks are at similar points.´´He argues that ´´the AUD also remains driven more by the outlook for global growth, particularly for China's economy.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) is attracting bids amid improvement in its safe-haven appeal amid geopolitical tensions. Also, investors are getting anxious ahead of the release of the United States Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data. Meanwhile, the 10-year US Treasury yields have also recovered to 3.31%. USD/JPY is defending further downside after dragging to near the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement (placed from March 24 low at 129.64 to April 03 high at 133.76) at 131.22 on an hourly scale. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 131.30 is still acting as a barricade for the US Dollar bulls. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is making efforts in climbing into the 40.00-60.00 range. Should the asset break above the immediate resistance of 131.50, US Dollar bulls would drive the asset towards 38.2% Fibo retracement at 132.19 followed by April 04 high at 133.17. On the contrary, a break below April 05 low at 130.63 would drag the asset towards the round-level support of 130.00. A break below the 130.00 support would expose the asset to March 24 low at 129.64. USD/JPY hourly chart  USD/JPY  ",0

"AUD/USD licks its wounds near the intraday low after China data allowed bears to take a breather during early Thursday. Even so, downbeat Australian trade numbers and risk-off mood weighs on the Aussie pair of late. That said, China’s Caixin Services PMI rallied to 57.8 versus 54.0 expected 55.0 prior. In doing so, the China data rallies to the highest level since November 2020. Earlier in the day, Australia’s headline Trade Balance improved to 13,870M versus 11,100 expected and 11,688M prior. However, Exports and Imports both dropped to -3.0% and -9.0% compared to 1.0% and 5.0% respective priors. Additionally challenging the AUD/USD bulls is the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Financial Stability Review (FSR) which mentioned the stress in the domestic construction sector and commercial lending. In addition to the mostly downbeat data at home, as well as from the biggest customer China, AUD/USD pair bears the burden of the market’s risk-off mood and the dovish bias of the RBA. That said, consecutive weakness in the US employment numbers raised fears of a recession in the world’s biggest economy and contagion risk associated with the same. On the other hand, RBAGovernor Philip Lowetried to appease hawks, following the RBA’s pause in rate hikes after 10 such increases. The policymaker ruled out rate cuts while also saying, “Balance of risks lean toward further rate rises.” Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures drop for the third consecutive day even if the benchmark US Treasury bond yields remain sluggish around the multi-day bottom. Having witnessed the initial reaction to second-tier data from Australia and China, the AUD/USD pair traders may rely on the risk catalysts for intraday directions. Also important to watch will be the weekly US jobless claims data ahead of Friday’s all-important Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP). To sum up, sour sentiment joins the dovish RBA bias to weigh on the AUD/USD prices but the broad US Dollar weakness challenges the Aussie pair bears. Technical analysis A convergence of a one-month-old ascending support line and the 21-DMA highlights 0.6680 as the key short-term key support for the AUD/USD pair traders to watch before welcoming bears.

"EUR/USDholds lower ground near the intraday bottom of 1.0884 as it prints two-day downtrend, after reversing from the highest levels since early February on Tuesday. That said,the Europair’s latest losses could be linked to the US Dollar’s corrective bounce amid recession woes and geopolitical fears. However, downbeat US data and comparatively hawkish bets on theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) than the US Federal Reserve (Fed) seem to put a floor under the EUR/USD prices. US Dollar Index (DXY) extends the previous day's rebound from a two-month low to 102.00 by the press time, up 0.12% intraday, as it cheers the greenback’s haven appeal amid fears of economic slowdown and geopolitical woes emanating from China and North Korea. While portraying the mood, S&P 500 Futures drop for the third consecutive day even if the benchmark US Treasury bond yields remain sluggish around the multi-day bottom. Recession woes gain momentum as consecutive weakness in the US employment numbers raised fears of a slowdown in the world’s biggest economy and contagion risk associated with the same. A disappointing 19-month low of the US JOLTS Job Openings for February precedes the ADP Employment Change for March which dropped to 145K from 200K expected and an upwardly revised prior of 261K. On the same line, the final readings of S&P Global Composite and Services PMIs for March also came in downbeat as the former one declined to 52.3 from 53.3 preliminary estimations while the Services PMI dropped to 52.6 from 53.8 anticipated earlier. More importantly, the US ISM Services PMI for the said month amplified pessimism as it dropped to 51.2 versus 54.5 expected and 55.1 prior. On the other hand, US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s talks with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen renewed the Sino-American tussles. On the other hand, North Korea on Thursday accused the U.S. and South Korea of escalating tensions to the brink of nuclear war through their joint military drills, vowing to respond with ""offensive action,"" state media KCNA reported per Reuters. It should be observed that CME’s FedWatch Tool suggests a nearly 57.0% of chance that the US central bank will pause its rate hike trajectory in May. Alternatively, the ECB’s 0.25% rate hike is almost given. With this in mind, ECB policymaker Boris Vujčić said on Wednesday, “The largest part of the rate-hiking cycle is behind us.” The ECB official also added that “to address core inflation, we might need to raise rates further.” Talking about the data from the bloc, Germany Factory Orders improved to -5.7% YoY for February from -12.0 revised down prior and -10.5% market forecasts while the MoM growth came in at 4.8% compared to 0.3% expected and 0.5% previous readings. It’s worth noting that Germany’s final readings of S&P GlobalBME Composite PMI for March confirmed 52.6 initial estimations while Services PMI eased to 53.7 versus 53.9 flash forecasts. On a broader front, Eurozone S&P Global Composite PMI eased to 53.7 in March versus 54.1 first readings whereas Services PMI also declined to 55.0 during the stated month from 55.6 preliminary forecasts. Looking forward, EUR/USD traders will be interested in more clues for Friday’s all-important Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP).

"The GBP/USD pair is hovering near Wednesday’s low at 1.2440 in the Asian session. The Cable is expected to extend its downside journey as geopolitical tensions between theUnited Statesand China over Taiwan have dampened the overall market mood. China’s retaliation over arms support to Taiwan by the US might result in some restrictions on exports from China to the US. S&P500 futures have generated decent losses in the Asian session, continuing its two-day losing streak amid deepening fears of a recession in the US economy. After five straight months of contraction in the US manufacturing sector, the weaker-than-anticipated US Services PMI has strengthened signs of a slowdown. Fortunately, the US Services PMI has not fallen into a contraction trajectory yet. US-China tensions have improved the safe-haven appeal of the US Dollar Index (DXY) firmly. The USD Index has shifted its auction above 102.00 and is expected to extend gains ahead. The demand for US government bonds is recovering in hopes that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will consider an early pause to the policy-tightening spell. This has eased some recovery in the 10-year US Treasury yields and has pushed them below 3.30%. As per the CME Fedwatch tool, the chances for a steady Fed interest rate decision are sticky above 50%. Going forward, the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data will provide clarity over the labor market condition. Scrutiny of US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment data is indicating a slowdown in the labor market ahead. On thePound Sterlingfront, Bank of England (BoE) policymakers’ anticipation that United Kingdom inflation will start declining quickly looks vague. There are no signs that UK inflation has started softening, however, a fresh jump in oil prices is expected to put more burden on households.  GBP/USD  ",0
"USD/JPY consolidates intraday losses around 131.20 as the US Dollar defends the previous day’s rebound from a two-month low heading into Thursday’s European session. Even so, the Yen pair remains on the way to reversing the last week’s gains, the first in five, amid downbeat Treasury bond yields. A likely monetary policy divergence between the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) appears to weigh on the Yen pair of late. The talks of the BoJ’s exit from the easy money policy under the new Governor's reign, especially when there prevails the need to reverse the 1.55 quadrillion yen ($11.7 trillion) of stimulus introduced during the last 10 years of Kuroda’s leadership, per Bloomberg. On the other hand, CME’s FedWatch Tool suggests a nearly 57.0% of chance that the US central bank will pause its rate hike trajectory in May. Even so, recession woes emanating from consecutive weakness in the US employment numbers and contagion risk associated with the same weigh on the sentiment while allowing the US Dollar to lick its wounds. That said, US Dollar Index (DXY) extends the previous day's rebound from a two-month low to 102.00 by the press time, up 0.12% intraday. It should be noted that the US JOLTS Job Openings for February previously slumped to the lowest levels in 19 months and bolstered job fears while ADP Employment Change for March dropped to 145K from 200K expected and an upwardly revised prior of 261K. On the same line, the final readings of S&P Global Composite and Services PMIs for March also came in downbeat as the former one declined to 52.3 from 53.3 preliminary estimations while the Services PMI dropped to 52.6 from 53.8 anticipated earlier. More importantly, the US ISM Services PMI for the said month amplified pessimism as it dropped to 51.2 versus 54.5 expected and 55.1 prior. Elsewhere, geopolitical fears emanating from China and North Korea also weigh on the sentiment and back the USD/JPY rebound. Earlier in the day, US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s talks with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen renewed the Sino-American tussles. On the other hand, North Korea on Thursday accused the U.S. and South Korea of escalating tensions to the brink of nuclear war through their joint military drills, vowing to respond with ""offensive action,"" state media KCNA reported per Reuters. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures drop for the third consecutive day even if the benchmark US Treasury bond yields remain sluggish around the multi-day bottom. That said, the US 10-year Treasury bond yields dropped in the last five consecutive days to refresh a seven-month low on Wednesday while the two-year counterpart also printed a four-day downtrend. Looking forward, headlines surrounding China and the second-tier US employment data are crucial for the intraday direction of the USD/JPY. However, major attention should be given to Friday’s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) for a clear guide.

"AUD/USD has surrendered the round-level support of 0.6700 in the early European session. The Aussie asset is declining towards Wednesday’s low at 0.6675 as deepening United States-China tensions over Taiwan have trimmed therisk appetiteof the market participants. US’s promise of delivering arms to Taiwan on a timely basis and strengthening economic cooperation on trade and technology has made China uneasy. China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson made an allegation against the US after the commentary from US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy for breaking commitment over the Taiwan issue. The event has triggered volatility for the Australian Dollar. It is worth noting that Australia is the leading trading partner of China and the deterioration of US-China relations would have a cascading effect on the Australian Dollar. Escalating US-China tensions have trimmed the appeal for risk-perceived assets. S&P500 futures have stretched losses on expectations that US-China tensions could lead to some sanctions on the dragon economy. USequitieshave been registering bearish settlements for the past two trading sessions amid evidence of a slowdown in the US economy. The US Dollar Index (DXY) looks firm above 102.00 and is expected to extend its recovery further. However, the slowing US labor market could restrict its upside. The demand for US government bonds is recovering quickly in hopes that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will consider an early pause to the policy-tightening spell. This has dragged 10-year US Treasury yields to near 3.29%. Signs of cooling US labor strengthen amid lower job additions On Wednesday, the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) agency reported a decline in the number of job additions in the month of March. The US economy added 145K jobs in March, significantly lower than the estimates of 200K and the former release of 242K. Firms have slowed down their hiring process amid rising interest rates by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and a bleakeconomic outlook. A slowdown in the recruitment process after the release of weak Job Openings data indicates that the US labor market has started cooling off and chances are solid of an escalation in the Unemployment Rate ahead. However, investors will get more clarity about the labor market condition after the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data, which is scheduled for Good Friday. As per the consensus, the jobless rate is seen unchanged at 3.6%. An economic indicator that could prompt US consumer inflation expectations is the Average Hourly Earnings data. The street is anticipating a deceleration in the annual labor cost index to 4.3% from the former release of 4.6%. However, monthly wage data could accelerate by 0.3% against the former increment of 0.2%. Reserve Bank of Australia opens gates for further rate hikes Considering the current monetary policy as restrictive enough to tame stubborn inflation, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept interest rates unchanged at 3.6% in its monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. However, Reserve Bank of AustraliaGovernor Philip Lowehas kept doors open for more rate hikes in case Australian inflation continues to remain persistent. It is worth noting that Australia’s monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) has softened quickly to 6.8% from the peak of 8.4% recorded in December. AUD/USD technical outlook  AUD/USD is auctioning in a Rising Channel chart pattern on a four-hour scale in which every corrective move is capitalized as a buying opportunity by investors. However, lack of momentum in the aforementioned chart pattern is advocating a downside move in the Aussie asset ahead. The Australian Dollar has failed in keeping the asset above the 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6730, which indicates that the long-term trend is bearish. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the 40.00-60.00 range, indicating a consolidation. A scenario of slipping into the bearish range of 20.00-40.00 is highly likely. Going forward, a break below April 03 low at 0.6650 will expose the Aussie asset to the round-level support at 0.6600. A crackdown below the round-level support would further drag the asset toward March 10 low at 0.6564. Alternatively, downside bias for the Aussie asst would vanish if it manages to climb above April 03 high around 0.6800. An occurrence of the same will drive the asset toward February 23 high at 0.6842 followed by February 13 low at 0.6890. AUD/USD  ",0
"TheGBP/USDpair attracts some dip-buying near the 1.2435 region on Thursday and for now, seems to have stalled this week's modest pullback from its highest level since June 2022. Spot prices climb nearly 50 pips from the daily low, albeit lacks follow-through and trade in neutral territory, around the 1.2465 zone during the early part of the European session. The US Dollar (USD) struggles to capitalize on the overnight bounce from over a two-month low and attracts fresh sellers on Wednesday, which, in turn, is seen lending some support to the GBP/USD pair. Rising bets for an imminent pause in the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-hiking cycle turn out to be a key factor acting as a headwind for the Greenback. In fact, the current market pricing indicates an even chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May and the possibility of rate cuts by year-end. The bets were reaffirmed by the disappointing release of the US ADP report on Wednesday, which showed that private-sector employers added 145K jobs in March as compared to 200K anticipated and the previous month's upwardly revised reading of 261K. Adding to this, the ISM Services PMI indicated a slowdown in growth during March, along with a deceleration in its Employment sub-index. The data suggested that the Fed's efforts to cool the labor market could be having some impact. Meanwhile, expectations that theFedis nearly done with its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes keep the US Treasury bond yields depressed near their lowest level in seven months. This, along with a stable performance around the equity markets, undermines traditional safe-haven assets, including the buck. The GBP/USD pair, however, fails to attract any meaningful buying and lacks bullish conviction amid mixed signals from the Bank of England (BoE) policymakers over the future rate-hike path. Traders also seem reluctant to place aggressive directional bets and prefer to wait on the sidelines ahead of the release of the closely-watched US monthly jobs data - popularly known asNFP- on Friday. In the meantime, traders on Thursday will take cues from the UK Construction PMI and the US Weekly Initial Jobless claims data. This, along with the broader risk sentiment, might influence the USD price dynamics and produce short-term trading opportunities around the GBP/USD pair. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1
"The single currency alternates gains with losses amidst a narrow trading range vs. the dollar and motivatesEUR/USDto keep business near the 1.0900 region on Thursday. EUR/USD appears cautious ahead of Friday’s NFP Following Wednesday’s sharp drop, EUR/USD now attempts some stabilization in the 1.0900 neighbourhood amidst the generalized prudent stance in the global markets and an equally flattish mood around the dollar. Market participants, in the meantime, keep the cautious stance ahead of the release of the key US Nonfarm Payrolls on Friday (+240K exp.), while expectations for a 25 bps rate hike by the ECB and a pause at the Fed’s meeting in May appear unchanged for the time being. In the domesticcalendar, Germany’s Construction PMI dropped to 42.9 in March, while the same gauge in the broader Euroland eased to 45.0. Earlier in the session, Industrial Production in Germany expanded at a healthy 2.0% MoM in February. In the US, the only release of note will be the usual weekly Initial Claims. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD clings to the 1.0900 region following the strong corrective decline seen in the previous session. In the meantime, price action around the single currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the incipient Fed-ECB divergence when it comes to the banks’ intentions regarding the potential next moves in interest rates. Moving forward, hawkish ECB-speak continue to favour further rate hikes, although this view appears in contrast to some loss of momentum in economicfundamentalsin the region. Key events in the euro area this week: Germany, EMU Final Services PMI (Wednesday) – Germany Industrial Production, Germany/EMU Construction PMI (Thursday). Eminent issues on the back boiler: Continuation, or not, of the ECB hiking cycle. Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the growth prospects and inflation outlook in the region. Risks of inflation becoming entrenched. EUR/USD levels to watch So far, the pair is losing 0.04% at 1.0898 and faces the next contention at 1.0788 (monthly low April 3) followed by 1.0745 (55-day SMA) and finally 1.0712 (low March 24). On the other hand, the surpass of 1.0973 (monthly high April 4) would target 1.1032 (2023 high February 2) en route to 1.1100 (round level).",0
"Rate hikes come with undesirable side effects. Therefore, Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research at Commerzbank, is sceptical about currentEUR/USDlevels. How much applause does one get for restrictive monetary policy? “Perhaps my perceptions are distorted, but I have the impression that the Fed’s restrictive monetary policy has received more criticism. I now see that those who defend the restrictive Fed policy are coming under fire. Perhaps my perception is due to the fact that this is exactly what I had expected; that criticism of its fight against inflation will start as soon asFedpolicy acts restrictively and actually dampens economic activity.” “For the ECB the revision of expectations was moderate also because the real economic effects of past rate hikes are not yet being felt quite so significantly. With an unemployment rate at record lows Europe is lagging the cycle, if you want.” “Because it can be assumed that the rate hikes will not remain without effects on the European economy and labour market either, I have my doubts that the recent EUR-strength is sustainable.”  ",0

"The USD/JPY pair attracts some dip-buying near the 130.80-130.75 region on Thursday and builds on its steady intraday ascent through the early part of the European session. The pair, for now, seems to have stalled this week's rejection slide from the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), though seems to struggle to capitalize on the momentum beyond mid-131.00s. The US Dollar (USD) edges higher for the second successive day and looks to build on the overnight modest recovery from over a two-month low, which, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. Apart from this, signs of stability in the equity markets undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and lend additional support to the major. That said, rising bets for an imminent pause in the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-hiking cycle hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and cap gains for the pair. Investors now seem convinced that the Fed is nearly done with its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes. In fact, the current market pricing indicates an even chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the May policy meeting and the possibility of rate cuts by year-end. The bets were reaffirmed by the disappointing release of the US ADP report on Wednesday, showing that private-sector employers added 145K jobs in March as compared to the 200K anticipated. The data suggested that the Fed's efforts to cool the labor market could be having some impact. This, in turn, keeps the US Treasury bond yields depressed near their lowest level in seven months. This results in the narrowing of the US-Japan rate differential, which drives some flows towards the JPY and contributes to keeping a lid on any meaningful upside for the USD/JPY pair. Traders also seem reluctant ahead of the release of the closely-watched US jobs data, or theNFPreport on Friday. In the meantime, the US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims might provide some impetus later during the early North American session on Thursday. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",0

Analysts at Credit Suisse stay bullish for what they look to be tougher resistance at 1.2668/1.2758, which includes its downtrend from May 2021. A break below 1.2274 can see a fall back to 1.2190/70 “With a bullish moving average ‘golden cross’ in place we maintain our core positive outlook for resistance next at 1.2668/1.2758 – the May 2022 high, 61.8% retracement of the 2021/2022 fall and long-term downtrend from May 2021. Our bias would then be to look for a cap here for a fresh phase of consolidation. Should strength directly extend though, we see resistance next at 1.2894, then 1.3000.” “Support at 1.2274 now ideally holds to keep the immediate risk higher.

"The US Dollar (USD) manages to hold its ground in the second half of the week after having suffered heavy losses against its major rivals earlier. The USD seems to be finding demand as a safe haven as investors grow increasingly concerned about theUnited States(US) economy tipping into recession. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for March, which will be released on Friday, could influence the market positioning regarding the US Federal Reserve’s next policy step and impact the USD’s performance. The US Dollar Index, which gauges the USD’s valuation against a basket of six currencies, holds steady at around 102.00 after having touched its weakest level since early February below 101.50 early Wednesday. Daily digest market movers: US Dollar finds its footing ahead of NFP Technical analysis: US Dollar stays fragile against Euro Despite Wednesday’s pullback, EUR/USD’s near-term technical outlook stays bullish with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart holding comfortably above 50. Moreover, the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) continues to pull away from the 50-day SMA following the bullish cross seen earlier in the week. 1.0900 (psychological level, static level) aligns as immediate support forEUR/USD. If the pair falls below that level and starts using it as support, it could extend its downward correction toward 1.0800 (psychological level, 20-day SMA), 1.0740 (50-day SMA) and 1.0680 (100-day SMA). On the upside, static resistance seems to have formed at 1.0950 ahead of 1.1000 (end-point of the latest uptrend, psychological level) and 1.1035 (multi-month high set in early February). How is US Dollar correlated with US stock markets? Stock markets in the US are likely to turn bearish if the Federal Reserve goes into a tightening cycle to battle rising inflation. Higher interest rates will ramp up the cost of borrowing and weigh on business investment. In that scenario, investors are likely to refrain from taking on high-risk, high-return positions. As a result ofrisk aversionand tight monetary policy, the US Dollar Index (DXY) should rise while the broad S&P 500 Index declines, revealing an inverse correlation. During times of monetary loosening via lower interest rates and quantitative easing to ramp up economic activity, investors are likely to bet on assets that are expected to deliver higher returns, such as shares of technology companies. The Nasdaq Composite is a technology-heavy index and it is expected to outperform other major equity indexes in such a period. On the other hand, the US Dollar Index should turn bearish due to the rising money supply and the weakening safe-haven demand.",0
"If the FX market considers the world to be more uncertain it mainly sees EUR-negative risks, Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research at Commerzbank, reports. There will always be some disaster somewhere “There will always be some disaster somewhere. As I do not know what that will be, I cannot tell whether the unpredictable will be EUR-positive or EUR-negative. But over the past quarters, higher risk perceptions was typically perceived as EUR-negative.” “The fact thatthe Eurois trading at relatively high levels at present is due to the fact that there is untypically little going on at present. If that changes and if the pattern seen over the past quarters does not change, the Euro might come under renewed pressure. That is another reason why I am somewhat sceptical about currentEUR/USDlevels.” ",0
"USD/JPY has extended its recovery. Nevertheless, economists at Credit Suisse view the current price action as a potential bearish “triangle” continuation pattern and they continue to look for the range to be eventually resolved lower. “Triangle” consolidation phase may last a while “We now look for further near-term strength in what is looking like the early stage of a potential ‘triangle’ continuation pattern. Resistance is seen next at 135.12, with tougher resistance expected at 136.67/137.30, which we look to cap.” “Big picture, if we are correct and we are seeing the formation of a bearish ‘triangle’ this would suggest we should see an eventual break below 129.64 later in Q2 for a retest of the 127.53/23 YTD low and 50% retracement of the 2021/2022 uptrend. Whilst a fresh hold here should be allowed for, we look for an eventual break for a fall to support next at the 61.8% retracement at 121.44. We would also expect such a fall to be in line with a broader market ‘risk off’ phase.” ",0
"Economists at Credit Suisse look forEUR/USDto eventually see a clear and sustained break above its downtrend from May 2021 and 50% retracement of the 2021/2022 bear trend for strength back to the 1.1035 YTD high, then resistance at 1.1185/1.1275. Initial support aligns at 1.0788 “EUR/USD remains well supported and is seeing a fresh and concerted retest of key resistance from the 50% retracement of the 2021/2022 fall and downtrend from May 2021 at 1.0921/44. We continue to look for an eventual sustained break higher for a retest of the 1.1035 YTD high. Whilst this should continue to be respected, we stay bullish for an eventual test of 1.1185/1.1275 – the 61.8% retracement and March 2022 high.” “Support is seen at 1.0788 initially, with 1.0714 ideally still holding. A break would warn of a fall back to the uptrend from last September, currently at 1.0630.” ",1
"The AUD/USD pair remains under some selling pressure for the third straight day on Thursday and trades just below the 0.6700 round-figure mark heading into the North American session. The Australian Dollar continues to be weighed down by the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) dovish outlook, which, along with a modest US Dollar (USD) strength, exerts some downward pressure on the AUD/USD pair. It is worth recalling that the Australian central bank on Tuesday paused its rate-hiking cycle following 10 consecutive raises and signalled that inflation had likely peaked. In the accompanying policy statement, the RBA noted that it wanted additional time to assess the full effects of past increases as the economy slows. The USD, on the other hand, edges higher for the second straight day and looks to build on the overnight modest bounce from over a two-month low, which is seen as another factor dragging the AUD/USD pair lower. The incoming macro data from the US pointed to slowing economic growth and revived recession fears. This, in turn, continues to weigh on investors' sentiment and benefits the Greenback's relative safe-haven status. That said, rising bets for an imminent pause in the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-hike cycle cap gains for the buck. In fact, the markets are currently pricing in an even chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC monetary policy meeting in May and see the possibility of rate cuts by year-end. The bets were lifted by the disappointing USeconomic releases, which suggested that the Fed's efforts to cool the labor market could be having some impact. This keeps the US Treasury bond yields depressed near their lowest level in seven months, which is holding back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and might limit losses for the AUD/USD pair, at least for now. The aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before positioning for any further depreciating move, though the price action suggests that the path of least resistance for the AUD/USD pair is to the downside. Traders, however, might prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of Friday's release of the closely-watched US monthly employment details - popularly known as theNFPreport. In the meantime, the USD price dynamics will be looked upon to grab some short-term trading opportunities around the major. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0
"GBP/USDconsolidates around key support in the mid-1.24s. Economists at Scotiabank expect the pair to extend its up move toward 1.2750. Firm support on modest GBP dips “Look for more range trading in the short run but expect firm support on modest GBP dips.” “The basic message from short-term price action (developing ‘bull flag’) remains essentially the same – a pause in the underlying bull trend before another push higher.” “Cable dips have been well supported at or just below 1.2440/45 (former highs and now major support).” “Trend momentum remains bullish, implying limited downside and ongoing upside risk (potential to 1.2750/00).” ",1
"EUR/USDtrades without a clear direction around the 1.0900 region on Thursday. The likelihood of extra advances appears favoured for the time being.

EUR should find firm support on dips “Given elevated core inflation data, it seems likely to me that policy hawks will continue to push for rate hikes outside of more severe market turmoil. A 25 bps hike is more or less fully priced in for May 4th at this point. A half point move remains a long shot but a hawkish policy outlook – tilting market pricing more firmly towards another 25 bps hike in June would still be EUR-supportive.” “A break under 1.0880 support would imply the risk of a short-term dip at least in the EUR back to the 1.08 area. Broader trends (and trend momentum) remain EUR-bullish, however, implying the EUR should find firm support on dips.” ",0
"The USD/JPY pair reverses an early North American session dip to sub-131.00 levels and climbs to a fresh daily top in the last hour, snapping a three-day losing streak. The pair moves further away from a one-week low touched on Wednesday and now trades around the 131.65-131.70 region, up nearly 0.30% for the day. The US Dollar (USD) is seen building on the previous day's bounce from over a two-month low and gaining some follow-through traction for the second successive day, which, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. That said, any meaningful upside still seems elusive amid growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is nearly done with its inflation-fighting rate hikes. In fact, the markets are pricing in an even chance of a 25bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May and the possibility of rate cuts by year-end. A larger-than-expected rise in the US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims comes on the back of the disappointing release of the US ADP report on Wednesday and suggests that the Fed's efforts to cool the labor market could be having some impact. The data lifts bets for an imminent pause in the rate-hiking cycle by the US central bank, which keeps the US Treasury bond yields depressed near a multi-month low. This, in turn, should hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and cap gains for the USD/JPY pair, at least for now. Traders might also prefer to move to the sidelines and wait for the release of the closely-watched US monthly employment data on Friday. The popularly knownNFPreport will play a key role in influencing market expectations about the next policy move by theFedand drive the USD demand.

"Economists at Wells Fargo believe the Bank of Japan will elect to deliver a policy shift later this year in Q4-2023. Such a policy move should see longer-term Japanese yields spike higher and add to their constructive medium-term outlook for the Yen. BoJ policy change on the horizon “We now believe the BoJ will take advantage of a tactical opportunity to further tweak its policy settings in Q4-2023, and we lean towards the October meeting in terms of timing.” “We expect the Bank of Japan's policy adjustment to be a further step towards normalizing Japan's government bond market. Specifically, we expect the BoJ to lift the target for the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to 0.25% from 0% and widen the tolerance band around that target to +/- 75 bps.” “While we are already positive on Yen's longer-term prospects, the likelihood of aBoJpolicy shift should accelerate yen gains. Thus, against a backdrop of an earlier Bank of Japan adjustment than we previously expected, we alsoforecasta stronger Yen.” “We now forecast the USD/JPY exchange rate to reach 124.00 by Q4-2023 and 120.00 by mid-2024, which would equate to a EUR/JPY exchange rate of 140.00 by Q4-2023 and 140.50 by mid-2024.” ",1
"ThePound Sterling(GBP) pullback from a 9-month high against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday dropped below the 1.2500 figure due to the buck’s renewed strength. The labor market in theUnited States(US) continues to deteriorate, painting a gloomy scenario for the US economy. The GBP/USD is trading at 1.2422 after hitting a high of 1.2486 GBP/USD drops as bad US jobs data underpin the greenback Wall Street is trading with losses. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending on April 1 exceeded forecasts of 200K, with data hitting 228K. Data linked to the labor market, namely the JOLTs job opening, ADP Employment Change, and the ISM Manufacturing PMI employment subcomponent, portrayed the labor market easing. That spurred an investor reaction, meaning that recessionary fears are the main reasons for the risk-off impulse seen in the last three days. GBP/USD traders bought the US Dollar, with the pair diving from around daily highs of 1.2480, toward the lows at 1.2412. US Treasury bond yields, particularly the most sensitive to interest rates, the 2-year, dropped to 3.674% before reversing its course and is up at 3.789%. Although the US 2-year Treasury bond yield has recovered, money market futures estimate that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would pause its tightening cycle at the May meeting. The odds of keeping rates unchanged are at 56.1%. In addition, some investors speculate that the Fed could cut rates as soon as July. On Wednesday, the ClevelandFedPresident Loretta Mester commented that rates need to rise “a little bit higher” and then hold them there for some time. She estimates that inflation will get to the Fed’s target by 2025. The US Dollar Index (DXY), a gauge for the greenback value against a basket of six currencies, posts back-to-back bullish candles and rises 0.22%, up at 102.104. On the UK front, the economy in the United Kingdom (UK) has fared well, contrasting the catastrophic economic projections by the Bank of England (BoE) and the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Projections foresaw an 18-month recession, though the economy has avoided a recession and even posted more robust growth numbers in January. In the meantime, expectations for a 25 bps rate hike by the BoE stay at 63% at the May meeting. GBP/USD Technical Analysis  After two straight sessions of registering losses, the GBP/USD stayed short of breaking to fresh three-day lows, below 1.2394, Tuesday’s low. If GBP/USD holds the spot price above the latter, it will keep buyers hopeful of breaking to new YTD highs above 1.2525. Upside risks lie at June 7 high at 1.2599, followed by May 27 pivot high at 1.2667. Contrarily, if GBP/USD drops past 1.2394, that would pave the way for a test of the 20-day EMA at 1.2290, below the 1.2300 psychological level. GBP/USD  ",0
"EUR/USDis topping the extreme of the day in late New York in holiday calmness. The pair is currently trading at 1.0930 at hourly resistance. The pair has traveled between a low of 1.0884 and a high of 1.0937. The focus at this point is the pivotal Nonfarm Payrolls and the impact of the Federal Reserve´s policy. The Greenback has been pressured of late following a week of troublesome data. As a prelude, the ADP National Employment report showed US private employers hired fewer workers than expected in March, suggesting a cooling labor market. Private employment increased by 145,000 jobs last month versus theforecastof 200,000. Additionally, the ISM's Non-Manufacturing index dropped to 51.2 in March from 55.1 in February. The services sector's employment indicator slid as well to 45.8 from 47.6 in February. Looking ahead the focus will be on US inflation and analysts at TD Securities said ""core prices likely cooled off modestly in March, with the index still rising a strong 0.4% MoM as we look for recent relief from goods deflation to turn into inflation this month.""

"The AUD/USD extends its losses to three consecutive days, as Wall Street is set to finish the week with gains, except for the Dow Jones, losing 0.02%. In the FX space,risk aversionwas the main driver of the session, weakening high beta currencies, like the Australian Dollar (AUD), which tumbled 0.74% vs. the buck. At the time of writing, the AUD/USD is trading at 0.6671. AUD/USD falls below 0.6700, weighed by the risk-off sentiment in the FX market On Thursday, the North American session was characterized by fluctuating sentiment, though US equity bulls lifted the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. TheUS economic docketfeatures Initial Jobless Claims for April 1, which jumped to 228K, above estimates of 200K, but trailed the prior’s week, which was upward revised to 246K. Since the beginning of the week, the employment index of the US PMIs has shown signs that hiring is decelerating. That was confirmed by the US JOLTs Opening report, which showed that vacancies shifted downwards. Therefore, growing speculations for a Federal Reserve’s (Fed) pause on its tightening cycle increased. On Wednesday, the ADP Employment Change report for March showed that companies hired fewer employees than expected. Given the backdrop, the latest US labor market data has sparked worries that an upcoming US recession is around the corner. Hence, the AUD/USD began Thursday’s session at around 0.6730s, the day’s high. Nevertheless, it resumed its downtrend, as the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls report and the Good Friday holiday motivated traders to book profits. OF late, the St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard commented that Q1’s incoming data is more robust than expected, adding that financial conditions are less tighter than the 2007-2009 crisis.Bullard said inflation would be “sticky going forward”and that theFed“needs to stay at it” to get inflation back to its 2% target. An absent Australian economic docket will leave traders focused on the release of theUS Nonfarm Payrolls. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the report on April 7 at 12:30 GMT. Most banks expect the US economy to add 240K jobs after a February increase of 311K. The Unemployment Rate is estimated to stay steady at 3.6%, while Average Hourly Earnings are declining to 4.3% YoY, vs. 4.6% in February. AUD/USD Technical Levels AUD/USD  ",0
"EUR/USDbulls keep the reins around 1.0920, retreating of late, as it portrays the typical Good Friday inaction, as well as anxiety ahead of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), during the early hours of the day. The major currency pair witnessed a volatile Thursday amid the initial US Dollar rebound on recession woes before ending the day unchanged with downbeat US data contrasting with firmer statistics from the Eurozone. Consecutive weakness in the US data and downbeat US Treasury bond yields triggered fears of a recession in the world’s largest economy, which in turn allowed the USD bears to take a breather during early Thursday. However, another set of downbeat US jobs report reversed the greenback’s gains afterward as traders brace for the all-importantNFP. That said, US Initial Jobless Claims improved to 228K for the week ended on March 31 versus 200K expected and upwardly revised 246K prior. It’s worth noting that the Challenger Job Cuts for the said month rose to 89.703K from 77.77K prior. It should be noted that Reuters raised fears of recession by citing the Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s preferred bond market indicator’s latest slump. “Research from the Fed has argued that the “near-term forward spread” comparing the forward rate on Treasury bills 18 months from now with the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill was the most reliable bond market signal of an imminent economic contraction,” said thenews. On the same line, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in her prepared remarks on Thursday that they expect the global economy to grow by less than 3% in 2023, down from 3.4% in 2022, per Reuters. Elsewhere, Germany’s Industrial Production (IP) rose 0.6% YoY in February versus -2.7% market forecasts and -1.6% previous readings. The monthly figures also came in firmer than 0.1% expected, to 2.0% versus 3.7% prior. On Wednesday, Germany Factory Orders improved to -5.7% YoY for February from -12.0 revised down prior and -10.5% market forecasts while the MoM growth came in at 4.8% compared to 0.3% expected and 0.5% previous readings. Amid these plays, Wall Street and US Treasury bond yields both pare weekly losses but fail to gain major acceptance from bulls. Moving on, off in the major markets can keep theEUR/USDinactive and vulnerable to sharp moves amid less liquidity on the scheduled US employment numbers for March. It’s worth mentioning that the recently dovishFedbets and downbeat US data give rise to hopes of a positive surprise and huge volatility in prices afterward.

"GBP/USD drops to 1.2430 as it extends the two-day downtrend to a sluggish Asian session on Good Friday. In doing so,the Cablepair pares the weekly losses, the fourth consecutive one, while easing from the top line of a one-month-old ascending trend channel. That said, the GBP/USD pair’s pullback from the short-term key hurdle also gains support from bearish MACD signals and the RSI (14) line’s retreat from the overbought territory, which suggests further declines of the quote. However, a one-week-old horizontal support area around 1.2430 currently restricts the Cable pair’s immediate downside ahead of an upward-sloping support line from March 08, close to 1.2375. It’s worth noting, though, that the GBP/USD pair’s weakness past 1.2375 will be tough as the stated channel’s lower line and the 100-SMA, respectively near 1.2350 and 1.2300, could challenge the bears before giving them control. On the contrary, recovery moves need to cross a downward-sloping resistance line from Tuesday, around 1.2475 by the press time. Even so, the latest multi-month peak of 1.2525, the highest since June 2022, will precede the aforementioned channel’s top line, around 1.2550, to challenge the GBP/USD buyers. Should the Cable pair remains firmer past 1.2550, backed by price-positive US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), the odds of witnessing a run-up to a May 2022 high of around 1.2665 can’t be ruled out.

"AUD/USD stays on the bear’s radar even as Good Friday-inflicted inaction prods the pair traders after a three-day downtrend. In doing so, the Aussie pair bears the burden of the recession woes, as well as the dovish Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) move, as it braces for the weekly loss ahead of the key US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP). The Aussie pair dropped in the last three consecutive days while aptly justifying the market’s pessimism surrounding the economic transition in the world’s largest economy, namely the US, as well as the contagion fears emanating from the same. Apart from the US-induced recession woes, RBA’s halt to the rate hike cycle and mixed Aussie data also weigh on the AUD/USD prices. On Wednesday, Australia’s headline Trade Balance improved to 13,870M versus 11,100 expected and 11,688M prior. However, Exports and Imports both dropped to -3.0% and -9.0% compared to 1.0% and 5.0% respective priors. Further, China’s Caixin Services PMI rallied to 57.8 versus 54.0 expected 55.0 prior. In doing so, the China data rallied to the highest level since November 2020. It’s worth noting that US Initial Jobless Claims improved to 228K for the week ended on March 31 versus 200K expected and upwardly revised 246K prior. It’s worth noting that the Challenger Job Cuts for the said month rose to 89.703K from 77.77K prior. Previously, US JOLTS Job Openings dropped to the 19-month low in February while the ADP Employment Change for March also disappointed markets with 145K figures. Further, the US ISM Services PMI for March also amplified pessimism as it dropped to 51.2 versus 54.5 expected and 55.1 prior. In addition to what’s mentioned above, geopolitical fears surrounding the US-China ties also weigh on the AUD/USD prices due to Canberra’s trade links with Beijing. Recently, the dragon nation showed a dislike of US-Taiwan relations and raised fears of worsening relations among the world’s top two economies, namely the US and China. On the same line are the Ukraine-Russia war and Moscow’s tussle with the West, as well as North Korea’s warning to use nuclear powers Amid these plays, the Wall Street benchmarks lick their wounds while the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields also stay pressured, despite the latest consolidation around 3.30% and 3.83% in that order. Moving ahead, the Good Friday holidays in major markets can restrict AUD/USD moves. However, the presence of the US jobs report can trigger volatility, especially amid thin market presence, which in turn requires more caution from the traders. Market forecasts suggest a softer print of the headline Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), to 240K from 311K prior, as well as no change in the Unemployment Rate of 3.6%. However, the mixed expectations for the Average Hourly Earnings make the outcome even more interesting. Technical analysis A daily closing below the 0.6680-85 support confluence, now immediate resistance comprising a one-month-old ascending trend line and the 21-DMA, keeps AUD/USD bears hopes of witnessing further downside.

"USD/JPY renews its intraday low near 131.60 as it justifies the upbeat Japan data amid sluggish markets due to the Good Friday holiday at major bourses. That said, the Yen pair remains on the way to posting weekly losses with the latest fall, especially amid increasing hawkish bias for the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The hawkish bias for theBoJintensifies amid upbeat Japanese data, as well as comments from the Japanese Finance Minister (FinMin) Sunichi Suzuki. “Inflation-adjusted real wages, a gauge of households' purchasing power, dropped by 2.6% in February from a year earlier, following a 4.1% fall in January that marked the fastest decline in nearly nine years,” per Reuters. It’s worth observing that Japan’s Overall Household Spending and Labor Cash Earnings also improved in February and favor the odds of the BoJ’s exit from the ultra-easy monetary policy. It should be noted that Japan’s FinMin Suzuki showed hopes of witnessing suitable policy and hence raise fears of hawkish stunts from the BoJ officials, especially amid Haruhiko Kuroda’s departure. Elsewhere, US Treasury bond yields pare weekly losses amid mixed concerns about the US recession and downbeat US data. With this, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields also stay pressured, despite the latest consolidation around 3.30% and 3.83% in that order. Further, “Research from theFedhas argued that the ‘near-term forward spread’ comparing the forward rate on Treasury bills 18 months from now with the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill was the most reliable bond market signal of an imminent economic contraction,” said Reuters. Above all, the divergence between the upbeat Japan data and disappointing US statistics keeps the USD/JPY pair on the bear’s table. However, the Yen pair’s further downside hinges on how well the US employment numbers can push back the recession woes. Forecasts suggest the headline Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) be 240K, down from 311K prior, as well as estimating no change in the Unemployment Rate of 3.6%. Technical analysis Although the 50-DMA restricts immediate USD/JPY upside to around 133.15, USD/JPY bears need validation from an upward-sloping support line from mid-January, close to 131.30 by the press time.

"USD/JPY struggles for clear directions as Good Friday’s off outside Japan joins mixed factors at home, as well as cautious mood ahead of the key US data, to challenge momentum traders. That said, the Yen pair seesaws around 131.60-70 while printing mild losses on its way to reverse the previous weekly gain, which was the first in five. Earlier in the day, Japan’s inflation-adjusted prices of household spending for February, also known as real wages, improved from a one-year low. On the same line were figures for Overall Household Spending and Labor Cash Earnings as both these catalysts improved for the said month. However, the actual figures still suggest a contraction in spending, which in turn pushes the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to propel markets. Together with the recently firmer data, the hopes of the BoJ’s exit from the easy-money policy also required the Japanese central bank to buy more bonds. As a result, the BoJ held record Japanese Government Bonds (BoJ) in March. It’s worth noting that the early 2023 edit of the Yield Curve Control and the stark dove Haruhiko Kuroda’s retirement from the BoJ’s Governorship also advocate the central bank’s hawkish move in the future and allow the JPY to remain firmer. Even so, Japan’s Finance Minister (FinMin) Shunichi Suzuki and Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno both signaled the continuation of the current monetary policy earlier in Asia. On the other hand, downbeat US data triggered recession woes and exert downside pressure on the US Dollar, as well as on the Treasury bond yields. Even so, the market’s risk-off mood and consolidation ahead of the key US jobs report for March put a floor under the US Dollar, which in turn prods USD/JPY bears. Apart from the US employment figures, a retirement speech fromBoJGovernor Kuroda will also be eyed closed for fresh impulse. While the downbeat market forecasts for the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) suggest more weakness of the USD/JPY pair, the recently easing hawkishFedbias and hopes of witnessing softer jobs report gives room for a surprise factor and a strong reaction to the same. On the other hand, increasing odds of the BoJ hawkish move also favor the Yen pair sellers.

Thenewsquotes a Cold Chain Federation while stating that new plans for post-Brexit border checks on goods coming into the UK will deter many EU suppliers and push up food prices.

"Speaking at his retirementnewsconference on Friday, outgoing Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that “Japan is seeing a broadening trend where rising inflation is being reflected in wages.” Additional quotes Japan has made steady progress toward sustainably, steadily achieving BoJ’s price target. Japan's tightening job market is laying groundwork for wages to rise more. Hope the ‘norm’ that wages, prices won’t rise will change and inflation target in tandem with wage hikes is achieved. If wages keep rising next year, we can foresee inflation stably, sustainably hitting BoJ’s price goal accompanied by wage growth. It is possible to exit from ultra-easy policy while ensuring financial system remains stable. Timing for achieving inflation target stably, sustainably is nearing as public perception that inflation, wages won't rise is starting to change. Govt-BoJ joint statement was appropriate in terms of achieving a non-deflationary situation, but won’t comment on future development. Not true that YCC is unsustainable compared to QQE. Most important thing is to carry on monetary easing to support economic growth, wage hikes. Not true that conducted policy with intention to bring surprises to financial markets.

"Euro bulls take a breather as the EUR/USD pair sits around 1.0920, awaiting the keyUnited Statesemployment numbers during early Friday. In doing so, the Euro pair also bears the burden of the Good Friday holidays in the major Western markets, including Europe. It’s worth noting, however, that the comparatively more hawkish bias for theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) than the Federal Reserve (Fed) keeps the EUR/USD on the way to posting the third consecutive weekly gain, despite recent recession woes. Euro cheers upbeat data EUR/USD remains firmer overall as the latest data from Germany and the Eurozone appear to keep the European Central Bank (ECB) hawks on the table, unlike their US counterparts. That said, Germany’s Industrial Production (IP) rose 0.6% YoY in February versus -2.7% market forecasts and -1.6% previous readings. The monthly figures also came in firmer than 0.1% expected, to 2.0% versus 3.7% prior. On Wednesday, Germany Factory Orders improved to -5.7% YoY for February from -12.0 revised down prior and -10.5% market forecasts while the MoM growth came in at 4.8% compared to 0.3% expected and 0.5% previous readings. On a broader front, Eurozone S&P Global Composite PMI eased to 53.7 in March versus 54.1 first readings whereas Services PMI also declined to 55.0 during the stated month from 55.6 preliminary forecasts. Elsewhere, the US Initial Jobless Claims improved to 228K for the week ended on March 31 versus 200K expected and upwardly revised 246K prior. It’s worth noting that the Challenger Job Cuts for the said month rose to 89.703K from 77.77K prior. Previously, US JOLTS Job Openings dropped to the 19-month low in February while the ADP Employment Change for March also disappointed markets with 145K figures. Further, the US ISM Services PMI for March also amplified pessimism as it dropped to 51.2 versus 54.5 expected and 55.1 prior. European Central Bank policymakers appear more hawkish than Federal Reserve talks Considering the upbeat data, European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Economist Philip Lane signaled in a university lecture in Cyprus that the May decision depends on three factors, namely inflation outlook, underlying dynamic and how quickly these interest rate increases are restricting the economy and bringing down inflation.” The policymaker also said that due to these reasons they haven’t indicated or pre-announced what the expectation is for the next meeting or the upcoming meetings. On the other hand, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Thursday he thinks inflation is going to be sticky going forward. With the comparatively more hawkish ECB policymaker's tone, the EUR/USD remains firmer ahead of the key data. Recession woes challenge Euro buyers It should be noted that the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred gauge of economic health cited the recession woes and put a floor under the EUR/USD prices. “Research from theFedhas argued that the ‘near-term forward spread’ comparing the forward rate on Treasury bills 18 months from now with the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill was the most reliable bond market signal of an imminent economic contraction,” per Reuters. On the same line are comments from International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva who said in her prepared remarks on Thursday that she expects the global economy to grow by less than 3% in 2023, down from 3.4% in 2022, per Reuters. All eyes on United States employment numbers Given the recently downbeat US employment clues, as well as the hopes of no rate hikes from the Federal Reserve (Fed), today’s US jobs report for March becomes crucial even as the Good Friday holiday is expected to limit the EUR/USD pair’s reaction to data. Market forecasts suggest a softer print of the headline Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), to 240K from 311K prior, as well as no change in the Unemployment Rate of 3.6%. However, the mixed expectations for the Average Hourly Earnings make the outcome even more interesting. Also read:Nonfarm Payrolls Preview: Markets fear depressing data, three scenarios for the US Dollar EUR/USD technical analysis EUR/USD stays within a three-day-old descending triangle chart pattern, suggesting further upside on the bullish breakout. Adding strength to the hopes of witnessing further Euro gains is the steady Relative Strength Index (RSI) line, placed at 14, not to forget the quote’s successful trading above the 200-Hour Moving Average (HMA). That said, the EUR/USD bulls need validation from 1.0930 to retake control. Following that, the latest peak of 1.0973 and the yearly high of around 1.1035 can testthe Eurobuyers ahead of directing them to the March 2022 high of near 1.1185. Meanwhile, a downside break of the 1.0885 level comprising the triangle’s lower line will defy the bullish chart pattern and can lure theEUR/USDbears.

The Unemployment rate fell by one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.5%. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.3% MoM, matching consensus.

TheEUR/USDis testing levels under 1.0880 amid a stronger Greenback. Further weakens in the pair could expose the next support at 1.0850 and then 1.0820.

At the time of writing, the GBP/USD trades volatile around the 1.2450-1.2370 range, below its opening price. US Nonfarm Payrolls below estimates, but the greenback rises Delving into March’s Nonfarm Payrolls data, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed the creation of fewer than 240K employments estimated, increased by 236, and trailed February’s 311K. Average Hourly Earnings, estimated at 4.3%, came at 4.2%, and the Unemployment Rate was at 3.5%YoY, below the expected 3.6%. GBP/USD 1-Hour Chart Reaction  The GBP/USD printed a new four-day low, at 1.2389, in a perception that the report was soft, but not as probably estimated to be a scenario that could weaken the USD. The GBP/USD tumbled below the S1 daily pivot, at 1.2405, with traders eyeing the S2 daily pivot at 1.2370. GBP/USD  ",0

At the time of writing, the USD/JPY trades in a wide range of 131.53-132.40, above its opening price. US Nonfarm Payrolls missed estimates, but the US Dollar strengthens The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data showed that employment in March decelerated to 236K, below the 240K expected by the street, and trailed 311K jobs added in February. Average Hourly Earnings came at 4.2% YoY, below expectations of 4.3%, while the Unemployment Rate was 3.4% YoY, 0.2% below the 3.6% foreseen. USD/JPY 1-Hour Chart Reaction  The USD/JPY jumped from around 131.50, a tick above the central daily pivot point at 131.48, and broke above the previous three-day high of 131.93, and did not look back on the reaction to the headline. On its way north, the USD/JPY cleared the R1 daily pivot point at 132.18 but fell short of testing the R2 pivot at 132.60. A clear breach of the latter, and the USD/JPY could test April 4 133.16 daily high before challenging the R3 pivot at 133.31.

"After the release of the March US employment report the US Dollar rose across the board, sending AUD/USD to 0.6639, the lowest level since March 27. The move was short-lived, and the pair is moving back toward where it was before the report near 0.6675. Overall, the reaction has been limited amid tight volume. A not negative jobs report The US Labor Department's jobs report showed Nonfarm Payrolls increased by 236K in March, near the 240K of markets consensus. The Unemployment Rate fell from 3.6% to 3.5%. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.3% MoM, matching consensus. Numbers did not show a negative surprise which was somewhat likely considering the latesteconomic reportsthat pointed to a softer labor market. March's NFP showed a slowdown in the pace of hiring, but still solid numbers. It is a quiet session, with many markets closed due to Good Friday. The reaction has been limited. US yields spike higher but then pulled back a bit. The US 10-year climbed to 3.38% and then pulled back to 3.34%, while the 2-year stands at 3.92%. Higher Treasury yields boosted the US Dollar.

However,the Euro(EUR) is set to finish the week with decent gains of 0.61%, though it ended short of reclaiming 1.1000. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD is trading at 1.0910, below its opening price by 0.07%. EUR/USD clings to 1.0900 on mixed US jobs data TheUS economic docketfeatured March’s jobs report, revealed by the US Department of Labor. Payrolls rose below estimates of 240k and hit 236K, but the data insights triggered a jump in odds for a US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) 25 bps rate hike. The Participation Rate jumped to 62.6%, from 62.4% foresaw, and the Unemployment Rate remained unchanged at 3.6% YoY. Average Hourly Earnings fell to 4.2% annually basis, beneath the consensus. Therefore, US Treasury bond yields extended their gains, with the 2-year US T-bond yield, the most sensitive to interest rates, climbing 16 basis points. The Fed swaps are repricing the May monetary policy meeting, with odds for a 25 bps rate hike by the US Federal Reserve itching up, to 67.0%, compared to Thursday’s 49.2%, as shown by theCME FedWatch Tool. Even though the European (EU) economic docket was absent, Klas Knot, anEuropean Central Bank(ECB) Governing Council Member, had crossed the wires. Knot commented the ECB is not done with interest rate hikes, as core inflation remains at 6%, three times the ECB’s 2% target. “The only question is whether you still need to take a further step up by half a percentage point, like the last few times we raised rates, or can you already scale back to smaller increments of a quarter of a percentage point,” he said. When asked about cutting rates towards the year’s end, Knot described such a scenario as “almost impossible.” Meanwhile, Worldwide Interest Rate Probabilities (WIRP) show odds for a 25 bps rate hike by the European Central Bank at 90%. Following that, another 25 bps rate increase is expected, and no movement for Q4. What to watch? The EU’s docket will feature Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Germany’s inflation, and a round of ECB speakers throughout the week.

While investors are expected to discount sluggishUnited StatesEmployment data released on Friday. S&P500 futures settled the week with marginal gains as investors were anxious about US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data, portrayed a quiet market mood. The US Dollar Index (DXY) remained sideways around 102.00 after US NFP-inspired volatility as investors are required to scrutiny the entire US employment gamut for further action. The US economy added 236K jobs in March, marginally lower than the expectations of 240K and critical lower than the prior release of 326K. The Unemployment Rate trimmed further to 3.5% from the consensus and the former release of 3.6%. Lower additions of fresh payrolls indicate that more rate from the Federal Reserve (Fed) are restricting firms to tap advances for expansion, which is impacting the demand for labor further. Average Hourly Earnings were trimmed to 4.2% vs. the estimates of 4.3% and the former release of 4.6%. However, on a monthly basis, the labor cost index improved to 0.3% from the prior release of 0.2% but remained in line with expectations, which indicates that higher employment bills could continue to keep inflationary pressures at elevated levels. Going forward, Chinese Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be the key highlight. The annual inflation data is expected to soften dramatically to 0.1% from the former release of 1.0%, which indicates bleak demand from households. This might impact theeconomic outlookof China as the economy is struggling to showstellarrecovery despite re-opening of the economy. It is worth noting that Australia is the leading trading partner of China and lower households demand in China would impact the Australian Dollar. AUD/USD  ",0
"EUR/USD seesaws around 1.0900 during a sluggish start to the key week amid Easter Holiday. Apart from the holidays, recently mixed concerns about the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) next move, as well as the European Central Bank’s (ECB) rate hike concerns also weigh onthe Europair. Hawkish bets on the Fed’s 0.25% rate hike increased after upbeat US employment data for March. However, the market participants also expect a rate cut in late 2023 and hence pour cold water on the face of the Fed hawks, which in turn please the EUR/USD bulls. That said, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 236K in March, the lowest since January 2021 (considering the revisions), versus 240K expected and 326K prior. Further, the Unemployment Rate eased to 3.5% versus 3.6% prior while the Labor Force Participation Rate improved to 62.6% from 62.5%. Finally, annual wage inflation, per the Average Hourly Earnings, dropped to 4.2% from 4.6%, versus market forecasts of 4.3%. Previously, US JOLTS Job Openings dropped to the 19-month low in February while the ADP Employment Change for March also disappointed markets with 145K figures. Further, the US ISM Services PMI for March also amplified pessimism as it dropped to 51.2 versus 54.5 expected and 55.1 prior. The downbeat US data also propels fears of a recession in the world’s largest economy and weigh on the US Dollar, as well as fuels the EUR/USD price. As per the latest research, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred gauge of economic health backed the recession woes, via bond market clues. Reuters said, “Research from the Fed has argued that the ‘near-term forward spread’ comparing the forward rate on Treasury bills 18 months from now with the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill was the most reliable bond market signal of an imminent economic contraction.” At home, upbeat German inflation clues and PMI data, as well as mostly firmer statistics from the Eurozone, allowed the ECB hawks to keep the reins and suggest further rate increases from the region’s central bank, which in turn propel the EUR/USD prices. That said, ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said on Friday that it is unclear whether a rate hike of 25 or 50 basis points is required. On a different page, China’s military drills near Taiwan Strait escalates US-China tension and allow the US Dollar sellers to take a breather after the US Dollar Index (DXY) posted a three-week downtrend.

On late Sunday, the Taiwan Defence Ministry reported that they spotted 58 Chinese aircrafts, which also includes nine ships. Meanwhile, State Media reported that the Chinese military told about keeping the momentum of drilling around Taiwan Island. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is putting efforts into defending its crucial support of 102.00 after a marginal correction. It is likely that geopolitical tensions would provide some support to the USD Index. The USD Index is likely to remain in action ahead of the release of theUnited StatesConsumer Price Index (CPI) data, which will release on Wednesday. Headline inflation is expected to soften further as oil prices remained weak in March, however, core inflation might accelerate as anticipated. S&P500 futures are showing some gains in the early Asian session, indicating some strength inequitiesahead of earnings season. On a two-hour scale, GBP/USD is expected to extend its correction to near the lower portion of the Rising Channel chart pattern. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2436 is restricting upside attempts from thePound Sterling. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is defending its downside around 40.00. A break below the same would trigger the bearish momentum. For a downside move, the Cable needs to deliver a breakdown of the Rising Channel pattern below March 23 high at 1.2343, which will expose the asset to the round-level support of 1.2300 followed by March 14 high around 1.2200. Alternatively, a decisive move above Friday’s high at 1.2453 will drive the asset towards April 04 high at 1.2525.

And, the Unemployment Rate tightened further to 3.5% vs. 3.6% as expected.

"GBP/USD takes offers to refresh the intraday low near 1.2400 during early Easter Monday morning in London. In doing so,the Cablepair drops for the fourth consecutive day as the US Dollar recovers amid the risk-off mood. Adding strength to the pullback moves could be the hawkish hopes from the US Federal Reserve (Fed), versus recent doubts about the Bank of England’s (BoE) next move. That said, fears emanating from China, mainly due to the dragon nation’s military drills near the Taiwan Strait, seem to underpin the US Dollar’s rebound. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s US visit triggered a fresh bout of US-China woes as Beijing conducts strong military drills near Taiwan Strait. “China's military simulated precision strikes against Taiwan in a second day of drills around the island on Sunday, with the island's defense ministry reporting multiple air force sorties and that it was monitoring China's missile forces,” reported Reuters. On the other hand, recently firmer US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) allowed theFedhawks to renew bets on the US central bank’s May-month rate hike. That said, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 236K in March, the lowest since January 2021 (considering the revisions), versus 240K expected and 326K prior. Further, the Unemployment Rate eased to 3.5% versus 3.6% prior while the Labor Force Participation Rate improved to 62.6% from 62.5%. Finally, annual wage inflation, per the Average Hourly Earnings, dropped to 4.2% from 4.6%, versus market forecasts of 4.3%. With this, the CME’s FedWatch Tool suggests 66% odds of the 0.25% rate hike in May, versus 55% before the US jobs report. On the other hand, the Bank of England (BoE) officials appear less hawkish and the rate suggests a pause in the rate hike trajectory even as the UK inflation remains the cause of concern. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 Futures remains directionless around 4,130, after a two-day uptrend, whereas the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields remain pressured near 3.37% and 3.95% respectively. In doing so, the benchmark bond coupons extend the previous day’s losses and portray the market’s rush toward the risk-safety amid economic slowdown fears. Looking forward, the Easter Monday holiday can restrict the GBP/USD pair’s intraday moves. However, this week’s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes will be crucial for near-term directions as riskier assets seem losing their charm. Apart from that, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s meeting with US President Joe Biden, in Northern Ireland, will join the debate on whether, when and how the ditching of European Union (EU) laws will start, in the UK’s House of Lords, to entertain the GBP/USD traders. It’s worth noting that the recently British-India ties and London’s ability to strike deals with multiple Asia-Pacific nations push back recession woes for the UK. However, the Bank of England (BoE) seems hesitant to convey the pessimism and hence Governor Bailey’s speech, up for publishing on Wednesday, will be eyed for clear directions.

However, the US refrains from speaking much as Reuters reports that the de facto US embassy in Taiwan said on Sunday theUnited Stateswas monitoring China's drills around Taiwan closely and is ‘comfortable and confident’ it has sufficient resources and capabilities regionally to ensure peace and stability. Apart from that, there is total silence from the US on this matter and hence therisk aversionseems cooling down of late, which in turn prods AUD/USD bears. Even so, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) pause on its rate hike trajectory joins downbeat Aussie inflation and Retail Sales data to keep AUD/USD sellers hopeful. On the same line could be the recently firmer US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) that allowed the Fed hawks to renew bets on the US central bank’s May-month rate hike. As per the latest data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) rose by 236K in March, the lowest since January 2021 (considering the revisions), versus 240K expected and 326K prior. Further, the Unemployment Rate eased to 3.5% versus 3.6% prior while the Labor Force Participation Rate improved to 62.6% from 62.5%. Finally, annual wage inflation, per the Average Hourly Earnings, dropped to 4.2% from 4.6%, versus market forecasts of 4.3%. It should be noted that the escalating chatters surrounding the global recession jostles with China’s belief to anchor the macro waves with its ultra-easy monetary policy and fiscal efforts seem to test the AUD/USD pair traders. Moving on, AUD/USD traders should pay attention to Australian employment numbers for clear directions. However, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes will be more important for clear directions. Should the US inflation remains firmer and theFedMinutes keep defending hawkish policy moves, the odds of witnessing the Aussie pair’s further downside can’t be ruled out. Technical analysis A clear downside break of the one-month-old ascending support line, now immediate resistance around 0.6690, keeps AUD/USD bears hopeful. However, Friday’s Dojicandlestickchallenges the Aussie pair sellers unless the quote trades below the previous day’s low of 0.6641. Additional important levels  ",0

Reviving bets for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) push the US Dollar (USD) higher for the fourth straight day, which turns out to be a key factor acting as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair.

In contrast, theBoEChief Economist Huw Pill said that action is still needed in assessing inflation prospects and that the onus remains on ensuring enough policy tightening is delivered to see the job through.

This also marks the third day of a negative move in the previous four and drags spot prices to a one-week low, around the 1.0860-1.0855 region heading into the North American session. A combination of supporting factors assists the US Dollar (USD) to gain strong follow-through traction on the first day of a new week, which, in turn, exerts downward pressure on the EUR/USD pair. In fact, the USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, spikes to a one-week high amid reviving bets for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed).

This, along with the flight to safety, triggers a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields and might hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. Furthermore, the growing acceptance of additional rate hikes by theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) should continue to underpin the shared currency and limit the downside for the EUR/USD pair amid relatively light trading volumes.

The pair is currently placed around the 133.30 mark, up nearly 0.90% for the day, with bulls now eyeing to challenge the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) barrier amid broad-based US Dollar (USD) strength. In fact, the USD Index, which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, builds on last week's recovery move from over a two-month low and gains strong follow-through traction amid expectations for further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The markets are now pricing in a greater chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC policy meeting in May and the bets were lifted by the mostly upbeat US monthly employment details released on Friday. This, in turn, continues to push the USD higher, which, along with dovish-sounding remarks by the new Bank of Japan (BoJ) GovernorKazuo Ueda, prompt aggressive short-covering around the USD/JPY pair. During his inauguration speech, Ueda ruled out any major policy shift and said that they want to avoid a sudden normalisation in monetary policy as it would cause a big impact on markets. This, in turn, weighs heavily on the Japanese Yen (JPY) and provides an additional boost to the USD/JPY pair. That said, the risk-off impulse - as depicted by a fresh leg down in the equity markets - could lend some support to the safe-haven JPY and keep a lid on any further gains for the major, at least for the time being. Against the backdrop of worries about a deeper global economic downturn, heightened US-China tensions over Taiwan tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets. This makes it prudent to wait for a sustained break through the 100-day SMA before positioning for any further appreciating move ahead of the US consumer inflation figures and the FOMC meeting minutes, due for release on Wednesday.

The price has now moved down to the next swing area between 1.2343 and 1.23603, where buyers are attempting to defend support.

"AUD/USD holds lower grounds near 0.6640 after declining in the last five consecutive days. In doing so, the Aussie pair not only justifies its risk barometer status but also respects the US Dollar’s broad recovery amid firmer yields, as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) induced bearish bias. That said, the previous Friday’s US employment numbers renew hawkish bets on the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) next rate hike of 0.25% in May and allowed the US Treasury yields to recover. As a result, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields rose to 3.41% and 4.0% at the latest. US Dollar Index (DXY) traced yields towards the north and rose for the fourth day in a row while poking a one-week high on Monday, around 102.55 by the press time. It’s worth noting that the receding fears of the banking crisis in the US and escalating US-China tension joined the firmer US Treasury bond yields to also propel the US Dollar Index, which in turn drowned AUD/USD prices. Furthermore, RBA’s pause to its rate hike trajectory in the last week also exerts downside pressure on the Aussie pair. Amid these plays, Wall Street benchmarks closed mixed, with minor moves, whereas the other riskier assets like commodities and Antipodeans stay depressed of late. Moving on, AUD/USD pair traders should watch Westpac Consumer Confidence for April ahead of China’s headline inflation numbers for March, namely the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI). Given the dragon nation’s recent optimism, coupled with the downbeat mood in Australia, any disappointment from the inflation numbers of a major customer won’t be taken lightly by the Aussie pair traders. Above all, Wednesday’s US CPI andFedMinutes will be crucial ahead of Thursday’s employment data from Canberra. Technical analysis A clear downside break of the one-month-old ascending support line, now immediate resistance around 0.6700, keeps AUD/USD bears hopeful of visiting the yearly low of around 0.6565.

"TheEUR/USDpair has climbed above the immediate resistance of 1.0860 in the early Asian session. The shared currency pair rebounded firmly after buying interest above 1.0830 in the early New York session. A corrective move in the US Dollar Index (DXY) resulted in a recovery inthe Euroafter a sheer sell-off. The downside bias for the major currency pair has not been over yet as investors are anticipating a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve (Fed) for its next month’s monetary policy. S&P500 futures showed astellarrecovery on Monday after a gap-down opening despite anxiety among investors ahead of result season. The street is worried about the earnings of commercial banks after the banking fiasco due to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. Also, tight credit conditions by US banks must have impacted advances needed by firms for fixed capital working capital management. The US Dollar Index (DXY) registered a gradual correction to near 102.54 as investors ignored China-Taiwan tensions despite the continuation of drilling by the Chinese military around Taiwan Island. The major trigger that will keep investors busy ahead is theUnited StatesConsumer Price Index (CPI) data, which will release on Wednesday. Analysts at TD Securities expect the headline inflation to rise by 0.1% in March and the core CPI by 0.4%. They see the CPI slowing to 3.6% by the fourth quarter. Also, the commentary from New York Fed Bank president John C. Williams conveys, Inflation will be around 3.75% this year. He added that the growth rate would be less than 1%, and the Unemployment Rate would gradually rise to 4-4.5%. On banking turmoil, Fed Williams believes that higher rates by theFedwere not the cause of recent banking stress. Investors are awaiting the Retail Sales data for fresh impetus on the Eurozone front. Monthly Retail Sales (March) are expected to contract by 0.8% vs. an expansion of 0.3% recorded in February. And annual Retail Sales would contract further to 3.5% from a prior contraction of 2.3%. This might delight theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) but is insufficient to back a neutral stance for upcoming monetary policy meetings. EUR/USD  ",1
"GBP/USD prints the first daily gains in five around 1.2390 as full markets return on Tuesday. In doing so,the Cablepair bounces off the lowest levels in a week. That said, a two-week-old ascending trend line, around 1.2355 by the press time, triggered the GBP/USD pair’s rebound the previous day. However, the quote’s sustained trading below the 10-DMA hurdle and an impending bear cross on the MACD keeps GBP/USD sellers hopeful. Adding strength to the downside bias is the RSI (14) line’s retreat from the overbought territory. Hence, the quote’s latest rebound remains elusive unless it stays below the 10-DMA hurdle of 1.2405. Even if the GBP/USD buyers manage to cross the 1.2405 resistance, a four-month-old horizontal line and previous support trend line stretched from mid-March, respectively near 1.2445 and 1.2510, could challenge the pair’s further upside. It’s worth noting that the latest multi-month high of 1.2525, marked the last week, also acts as an extra upside filter to watch for Cable buyers. On the flip side, the aforementioned support line stretched from March 24, close to 1.2355, restricts the immediate downside of the GBP/USD pair, a break of which could quickly drag the quote towards 1.2300 and then to February’s high of near 1.2270.

"The USD/JPY pair has corrected below the critical support of 133.50 in the Asian session after astellarupside move to near 133.87. The corrective move in the asset is a trace of correction in the US Dollar Index (DXY), which took place after an improvement in therisk appetiteof the market participants. Notably, the proportion of correction in the USD/JPY pair is much less than the corrective move in the USD Index, which indicates weakness in the Japanese Yen. Japan’s domestic currency went through significant offers on Monday after a dovish commentary from novel Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda. BoJUeda said on Monday that the central bank is reluctant to approach a sudden normalization of monetary policy as it would have a big impact on the Japanese economy, as reported by Reuters. The commentary has supported the continuation of ultra-loose monetary policy for an extended period as the global economy is going through a rough phase due to the banking crisis. He added, ""Fully aware that global economy is slowing and a further slowdown is expected."" Also, the strengthening of wage growth supports inflation to reach its target sustainably. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures have added further gains after minor additions on Monday, portraying further improvement in the risk-taking ability of the market participants. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has extended its correction sharply below 102.50 as investors have digested the expectations of further policy-tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed). USD/JPY  ",1
" EUR/USDrenews intraday high near 1.0880 as bulls struggle to retake control after a two-day downtrend during early Tuesday. In doing so,the Europair rebounds from a convergence of the 100-SMA and a two-week-long ascending support line. The major currency pair’s recovery moves, however, remain elusive unless the quote remains below the 13-day-old horizontal resistance area surrounding 1.0930. That said, a one-week-old descending trend line, around 1.0900 by the press time, guards the EUR/USD pair’s immediate upside. In a case where the EUR/USD remains firmer past 1.0930, the monthly high of around 1.0975 may act as the last defense of the pair sellers ahead of directing the price towards February’s peak of 1.1033. Alternatively, a downside break of 1.0840-45 support confluence won’t hesitate to drag the quote toward the monthly low of 1.0788. However, the 50% and 61.8%Fibonacciretracement levels of the pair’s March-April upside, respectively near 1.0745 and 1.0690, can challenge the EUR/USD bears afterward. To sum up, EUR/USD bulls need to cross 1.0930 to regain the market’s confidence. Otherwise, the quote remains on the bear’s radar even if 1.0845-40 restricts the short-term downside.

" China’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in at 0.7% than a year earlier in March, rising slower than the 1.0% annual gain seen in February, the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Tuesday. The market consensus was for a 1.0% increase. On a monthly basis, the country’s CPI data dropped by 0.3% in March versus 0.1% expected and -0.5% booked in February. China’s Producer Price Index (PPI) decelerated by 2.5% YoY in March, compared with the -2.5% expectations and -1.4% previous reading. Market reaction At the time of writing, AUD/USD is little changed on the data release, keeping the green near 0.6650, up 0.15% on the day. ",0
"The AUD/USD pair has slipped below 0.6650 as China’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) has softened despite various measures from the Chinese administration to stem economic recovery. Annual China inflation data has eased to 0.7% from the consensus and the former release of 1.0%. On a monthly basis, the Chinese economy has shown deflation by 0.3% while the street was expecting an acceleration in prices of goods and services by 0.1%. This indicates poor demand from households, raising questions about the economic prospects of the Chinese economy despite reopening with various stimuli. It is worth noting that Australia is the leading trading partner of China, and weaker Chinese economic prospects will dampen the Australian Dollar. This week, the Australian Dollar will remain in action amid the release of March’s Employment data, which will release on Thursday. The street is anticipating adding fresh 20K jobs in the Australian economy, lower than the former release of 64.6K. While the Unemployment Rate is expected to increase to 3.6% vs. 3.5%, released in February. A labour demand slowdown should result from higher rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). RBAGovernor Philip Lowehas already commented that the Australian economy will slow further due to higher interest rates, and inflation will soften too. Easing labor market conditions would support the RBA in maintaining its monetary policy unchanged. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures show choppy moves with some positive bias from the previous trading session, indicating little strength in bulls in a quiet market. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has recovered after an extended correction to near 102.40. Going forward, the release of theUnited Statesinflation data will guide the further direction of the market. As per the consensus, the headline inflation will soften to 5.2% from the former release of 6.0%. Also, monthly headline CPI would decelerate to 0.3% from 0.4% reported earlier. While annual core inflation that excludes oil and food prices could surprisingly jump to 5.6% from the former release of 5.5%. AUD/USD  ",0

"USD/JPY drops to 133.40 as bulls take a breather after a three-day uptrend during early Tuesday. In doing so, the Yen pair takes a U-turn from a three-week-old horizontal resistance area, as well as the 200-SMA. Adding strength to the pullback moves could be the RSI (14) retreat from the overbought territory. As a result, the Yen pair is well-set for further downside towards the 132.40-35 support confluence including the 50-SMA and one-week-old ascending trend line. It should be noted, however, that there prevails limited room towards the south for the USD/JPY pair even if it breaks the 132.35 key support. The reason could be linked to an upward-sloping support line from March 24, close to 131.10 by the press time. In a case where the USD/JPY bears keep the reins past 131.10, and also conquer the 131.00 round figure, the odds of witnessing a fresh 2023 low, currently around 127.20, can’t be ruled out. On the contrary, the 200-SMA level of 133.60 precedes the aforementioned three-week-old horizontal resistance area surrounding 133.75-85 to limit the short-term upside of the USD/JPY pair. Following that, the mid-March high of 135.05 acts as an intermediate halt during the likely run-up towards the YTD peak marked in the previous month at around 137.95.

"TheEUR/USDpair is approaching swiftly towards the round-level resistance of 1.0900 in the Asian session. The major currency pair has extended its rally above 1.0880 as investors have digested the expectations of one more 25 basis points (bps) rate hike from the Federal Reserve (Fed). The upbeat market mood has forced the US Dollar Index (DXY) for an extended correction. The USD Index has slipped further to near 102.33 amid positivemarket sentiment. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures have generated some gains ahead of the quarterly result season. As per Refinitiv estimates, S&P500 is expected to report a shrinkage in profits by 5.2% vs. a growth forecast of 1.4% anticipated at the start of the year. Higher rates by theFedand tight credit conditions by US commercial banks have forced investors to downgrade growth for S&P500. The declining USD Index has supported demand for US government bonds. This has led to a decline in the 10-year US Treasury Yields to 3.40%. The US Dollar is expected to remain highly volatile as investors are awaiting the release of Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Analysts at TD Securities expect the headline inflation to rise by 0.1% in March, and the core CPI by 0.4%. They see the CPI slowing to 3.6% by the fourth quarter. On the Eurozone front,the Eurowill be impacted by Retail Sales (Mar) data. Monthly Retail Sales data could contract by 0.8%. And, annual Retail Sales could contract further to 3.5%.

"AUD/USD bulls are back in motion, after a week-long absence, as upbeat Aussie catalysts surrounding foreign trade and sentiment underpin the quote’s latest recovery from a three-week low to 0.6670 heading into Tuesday’s European session. Not only the price-positive factors surrounding Australia but the overall improvement in therisk appetitealso favors the quote’s latest rebound. That said, Australia’s Westpac Consumer Confidence for April rallied to the highest levels since June 2022, printing 9.4% figure versus 0.8% expected and 0.0% prior. Further, the National Australia Bank’s (NAB) Business Conditions matched theforecastfigure of 16.0, versus 17.0 prior, whereas NAB Business Confidence eased to -1.0 versus 0.0% expected and -4.0% previous readings. On the contrary, China’s headline inflation numbers for March, namely the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), came in 0.7% YoY and -2.5% YoY versus 1.0% and -1.4% respective priors. Apart from mostly upbeat Aussie data, headlines from Reuters suggesting an end of the trade dispute between Australia and China over barley exports also seemed to have favored the AUD/USD prices. Elsewhere, fresh doubts on the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) capacity to stay hawkish, backed by downbeat comments from New York Fed John Williams and fears of recession spread by BlackRock, seem to weigh on the US Dollar and allow the AUD/USD to remain firmer. Amid these plays, the S&P 500 Futures print mild gains around 4,143 at the latest while the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields retreat to 3.40% and 3.97% by the press time. Moving on, risk catalysts and the return of full markets may entertain AUD/USD pair traders ahead of Wednesday’s key US inflation andFedMinutes, as well as Thursday’s Aussie jobs report.

"UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Market Strategist Quek Ser Leang note further downside inEUR/USDshould meet firm contention around 1.0790. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We did not expect the rapid drop in EUR to 1.0830 (we were expecting it to trade sideways). While the sharp drop appears to be running ahead of itself, there is scope for EUR to retest the 1.0830 level before a more sustained rebound is likely. The next major support at 1.0785 is unlikely to come into view. On the upside, a breach of 1.0895 would suggest that 1.0830 is not coming back into view for now.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (10 Apr, spot at 1.0905), we held the view that EUR is likely to consolidate between 1.0870 and 1.0970 before heading higher at a later stage. We did not anticipate the rapid drop below 1.0840 (low has been 1.0830). Downward momentum has improved somewhat and EUR is likely to edge lower for the time being. In view of the mild downward pressure, any decline is likely limited to a test of 1.0785.

"EUR/USD picks up bids to refresh intraday high near 1.0890 as European traders return from a long weekend on Tuesday. In doing so,the Europair cheers broad US Dollar weakness amid cautious optimism in the market, as well as fresh doubts on the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) hawkish moves. It’s worth noting that easing recession woes joins receding fears of more banking fallouts to prod the bond-buying and weigh on the Treasury yields. The retreat in yields and cautious mood ahead of the US inflation data, as well as the Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting minutes, weigh on the US Dollar. As a result, the US Dollar Index (DXY) snaps a four-day uptrend while declining to 102.35 by the press time, down 0.20% intraday. That said, the S&P 500 Futures print mild gains around 4,141 at the latest while the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields retreat to 3.40% and 3.97% by the press time. Late on Monday, the Federal Reserve (Fed) Bank of New York President, as well as the Fed’s Vice Chairman of the rate-setting committee, John Williams, raised doubts on the recently hawkish calls of the Fed 0.25% rate lift. Following him was Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, who said late Monday, “The Federal Reserve may not need to raise interest rates further to fight inflation, as the fallout from last month's turmoil in the banking sector and a series of recent labor data point to a slowing US economy,” per Reuters. Even so, CME’s FedWatch Tool prints nearly 68.7% odds of the US Central Bank's 0.25% rate hike in May, versus the previous day’s 71.2%, and challenges themarket sentiment, as well as the EUR/USD buyers. Also weighing on therisk appetiteand the Euro prices could be the downbeat China inflation data and anxiety ahead of top-tier US data/events. Moving on, EUR/USD pair traders should pay attention to Eurozone Retail Sales for March, expected -3.5% YoY versus -2.3% prior, for intraday directions.

Technical analysis EUR/USDrebounds from a convergence of the 100-SMA and a two-week-long ascending support line, around 1.0840-45, which in turn joins steady RSI to suggest a continuation of corrective bounce towards a 13-day-old horizontal resistance area surrounding 1.0930.

"GBP/USD has managed to shift its auction above the round-level resistance of 1.2400 in the early European session. The Cable has attracted bids as investors are showing maturity to the accelerating chances of more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve (Fed). The US Dollar has remained in a negative trajectory in the Asian session as anxiety among the market participants ahead of the release of theUnited StatesConsumer Price Index (CPI) has receded. The US Dollar Index (DXY) looks vulnerable above the immediate cushion of 102.30 as the market mood is extremely upbeat. S&P500 futures are holding nominal gains in the Asian session. USequitiesshowed resilience on Monday after a gap-down opening, which indicates that the downside is capped. Despite weaker consensus for profits to be delivered S&P500, investors are supporting the US equity domain. As per Refinitiv estimates, S&P500 is expected to report shrinkage in profits by 5.2% vs. a growthforecastof 1.4% anticipated at the start of the year. The downgraded forecast for S&P500 is backed by higher rates from the Federal Reserve and tight credit conditions from US commercial banks, which have squeezed advances to firms. Positivemarket sentimenthas also barricaded US yields from further upside. The 10-year US Treasury yields look sluggish below 3.41%. Investors digest hawkish Federal Reserve bets The market participants have ignored rising bets for a consecutive 25 basis points (bps) rate hike from the Federal Reserve and have started pouring funds into the risk-sensitive assets. Investors seem assured about the continuation of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve as the US labor market has not shown meaningful signs of slowdown despite higher rates and tight credit conditions. The US Dollar remained in a negative trajectory in the Asian session after less-hawkish commentary from New York Fed Bank president John C. Williams. Federal Reserve Williams stated that inflation will be around 3.75% this year, the growth rate will be less than 1% and the Unemployment Rate will gradually rise to 4-4.5%. This indicates that inflation will soften ahead and hopes for rate cuts will be alive. On banking turmoil, Fed Williams believes that higher rates by the Federal Reserve were not the cause of recent banking stress. This has reduced fears of further banking turmoil if the hawkish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is not responsible for banking collapse. US Inflation to remain a key trigger ahead Investors are very much curious about the release of the US CPI data as it will be the last inflation figures before the interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, which will be announced in the first week of May. Therefore, Wednesday’s US Inflation data carries a higher value. Analysts at TD Securities expect the headline inflation to rise by 0.1% in March, and the core CPI by 0.4%. They see the CPI slowing to 3.6% by the fourth quarter. March’s US headline inflation is expected to be softened by consistently lower oil prices, which had eventually provided gas to end consumers at more affordable prices. While core inflation could be spurted due to the higher labor cost index, which has filled households with ample funds for disposal. UK inflation to remain persistent ahead The United Kingdom is one of the nations that are critically struggling to bring down galloping inflation. Interest rates by the Bank of England (BoE) have reached decade highs, and the UK administration has offered monetary incentives for postponement of early retirement, however, the price index has not shown any sign of softening yet. The release of the Like-for Like Retail Sales by the British Retail Consortium remained steady at 4.9%. A continuation of robust retail demand is expected to keep inflationary pressures at elevated rates. GBP/USD technical outlook  GBP/USD is gathering strength to deliver a breakout of the Falling Channel formed on an hourly scale. The Cable showed a reversal on Monday after observing the presence of responsive buyers around 1.2350. ThePound Sterlinghas pushed the asset above the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around 1.2400, which indicates that the short-term trend has turned bullish.

"USD/JPYcould enter in a brief consolidation period ahead of a potential move to 134.40 in short term, suggest UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Market Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected USD to strengthen yesterday but we were of the view that ‘any advance is unlikely to break the major resistance at 133.30’. The anticipated advance exceeded our expectations as USD lifted off and soared to a high of 133.87. The rapid rise is deep in overbought territory and USD is unlikely to advance much further. Today, USD is more likely to consolidate and trade between 132.60 and 133.90.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (10 Apr, spot at 132.50), we noted that ‘upward momentum is building’ and we expected USD to trade with an upward bias towards 133.35. While our view of a stronger USD was correct, we did not anticipate the manner in which it surged above 133.35 (high has been 133.87). Further USD strength is not ruled out but overbought short-term conditions could lead to a couple of days of consolidation first. Overall, as long as 132.00 (‘strong support’ level was at 131.10 yesterday) is not breached, USD could rise to 134.40 later on.”",1

The pair maintains its bid tone through the early part of the European session and is currently placed near the top end of the daily trading range, around the 0.6665-0.6670 area, up nearly 0.50% for the day. The Australian Dollar gets a goodish lift after domestic data indicated an improvement in consumer sentiment in the wake of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) rate-hike pause earlier this month. In fact, the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment index bounced from near-record lows and jumped 9.4% to 85.8 in early April, recording its fastest rise since late-2020. Adding to this, the National Australia Bank Business Confidence Index improved to -1 from -4 previously, suggesting that the economy is still holding up. Apart from this, a generally positive tone around the equity markets undermines the safe-havenUS Dollar(USD) and further benefits the risk-sensitiveAussie. The USD downtick, however, is likely to remain cushioned amid speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may continue raising interestrates. In fact, the current market pricing indicates a greater chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC monetary policy meeting in May, the bets lifted by the mostly upbeat US employment details (NFP) released on Friday. The prospects for further policy tightening by theFed, meanwhile, puts a floor under the US Treasury bond yields, which should further act as a tailwind for the Greenback and contribute to capping gains for the AUD/USD pair. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive bets and prefer to wait for this week's important releases from the US – the latest consumer inflation figures and the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday. This, along with the USRetail Salesdata on Friday, will influence the near-term USD price dynamics. In the meantime, the US bond yields will drive the USD demand and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair. Traders will further take cues from the broader risk sentiment to grab short-term opportunities. Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before confirming that the recent rejection slide from the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) has run its course.

"We were able to experience the new governor of the Bank of Japan (BoJ), Kazuo Ueda, in his new role for the first time yesterday. Everything remains unchanged. That was JPY-negative initially. Ulrich Leuchtmann, Head of FX and Commodity Research at Commerzbank, analyzes the management of JPY risks. Ueda leaves everything unchanged “What he had to say was in no way positive for JPY, as he underlined that he would continue his predecessor’s ultra-expansionary monetary policy. The indicator of this is the yield curve control (YCC) which would probably be the first element to change in a possible exit scenario. However, Ueda rejected this kind of change. In other words: everything remains unchanged.” “Tthe Yen is only likely to appreciate long-term if there is this early move away from current monetary policy. Otherwise, it will mean: If theBoJwaits for too long, the Yen might easily suffer despite increased (real) yields. Or inflation eases back below the BoJ’s target level (2%). At that point we would be back to square one, which means a move away from the ultra-expansionary monetary policy would be unlikely. Short, medium and long-term.” “Anyone who has already read the IMF’s latest ""World Economic Outlook"" and who follows its view might come to the conclusion that after the current inflation shock has worn off real yields in the rest of the world will be back at low levels. Followers of that view might not be excessively JPY-pessimistic, as the real yield disadvantage of the Yen would be reasonably moderate in that case.” ",0

Instead,EUR/USDis trading in a narrow range and waiting for its next major input, probably from the western side of the Atlantic.” “EUR/USD can edge back up to the 1.0930/50 area today assuming that equities stay mildly bid and the US NFIB data emerges on the soft side.” ",1
"The USD/JPY pair recovers after coming under some selling pressure on Tuesday which eroded a part of the previous day's strong gains to the 133.85 region, or its highest level since mid-March. Spot prices remain supported by both the 50 and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) clustered in the 133.20s, just under where price is trading at the time of writing. TheUS Dollar(USD) meets with some supply and stalls a four-day-old recovery trend from over a two-month low touched last week, which, in turn, is seen dragging the USD/JPY pair lower. The USD downtick, however, seems limited amid speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may continue raising interestrates. In fact, the current market pricing indicates a greater chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC monetary policy meeting in May and the bets were lifted by the mostly upbeat US employment details (NFP) released on Friday. The prospects for further policy tightening by theFed, meanwhile, puts a floor under the US Treasury bond yields, which should further act as a tailwind for the Greenback. Apart from this, the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) dovish near-termoutlook, along with a generally positive tone around the equity markets, could undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and help limit losses for the USD/JPY pair. It is worth recalling that the newBoJGovernor Kazuo Ueda said on Monday it was appropriate to maintain the ultra-loose stance as inflation has yet to hit 2% as a trend. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of this week's key data/event risks from the US – the release of consumer inflation figures and the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday. This, along with the USRetail Salesreport on Friday, will play a key role in influencing the USD price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to theUSD/JPY pair. This makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before positioning for any meaningful slide in the absence of any relevant data on Tuesday. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",0

Also collaborating with the bounce in the pair emerges another positive performance of the German 10-year Bund yields, which approach the 2.30% region and add to Thursday’s gains. In the meantime, investors continue to gauge a most likely 25 bps rate hike by both the ECB and the Federal Reserve.

What to look for around EUR EUR/USD clings to the 1.0900 region following the marked retracement seen in the last couple of sessions.

However, theUSDJPYis set to struggle at between 135 and 137, key resistance levels, economists at MUFG Bank report. BoJ will abandon yield curve control this year “The paring back of expectations for a more immediate shift to BoJ policy settings under new Governor Ueda will take some of the wind out the Yen’s sails, and make it harder for the JPY to extend its advance ahead of the BoJ’s policy meeting later this month. We are still of the view though that theBoJwill abandon yield curve control this year so any Yen weakness on the back of maintaining current policy settings is unlikely to prove sustainable.” “Furthermore, with US yields having peaked out, it should help dampen upside potential for USD/JPY in the near-term with important resistance levels coming in between 135.00 and 137.00.” ",0
"TheUS Dollar(USD) stays on the back foot on Tuesday and weakens against its major rivals as investors gear up for the highly anticipated MarchConsumer Price Index(CPI) data from the US. The US Dollar Index, which closed the previous four trading days in positive territory, retreats toward 102.00, reflecting the lack of demand for the currency. Previewing the potential impact of the US CPI data on the USD, ""the USD's downtrend could stall a bit in the short-term, aided by the expectations of anotherFedhike next month,"" said TD Securities analysts. ""However, much will hinge on the near-term data releases, especially the March CPI print."" Ahead of the weekend, the USD gathered strength as investors started to price in a 25 basis points (bps) US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hike in May on the back of the upbeat March jobs report. With trading conditions normalizing after a long weekend, however, US Treasury bond yields started to push lower, making it difficult for the USD to continue to outperform its peers. Moreover, the improving risk mood seems to be putting additional weight on the USD’s shoulders.

The pair, however, managed to regain its traction on Tuesday and rose above the 1.0900 area. The pair’s near-term technicaloutlookremains bullish with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the daily chart holding above 50. Moreover, EUR/USD has reversed its direction after coming in within a touching distance of the 20-day Simple Moving Average, which currently aligns as immediate support at 1.0830. In case EUR/USD stabilizes above 1.0900, it is likely to face resistance at 1.0950 (static level) before targeting 1.1000 (end-point of the latest uptrend, psychological level) and 1.1035 (multi-month high set in early February). On the downside, 1.0830 (20-day SMA) aligns as first support before 1.0800 (psychological level), 1.0740 (50-day SMA) and 1.0700 (100-day SMA). What is US Dollar Index (DXY)? The US Dollar Index, also known as DXY or USDX, is a benchmark index that was established by the US Federal Reserve in 1973. DXY is widely used as a tool measuring the US Dollar (USD) value in global markets. The index is calculated by measuring the US Dollar’s performance against a basket of six foreign currencies, the Euro, the Japanese Yen (JPY), Swedish Krona (SEK), the British Pound (GBP), the Swiss Franc (CHF) and the Canadian Dollar (CAD). With 57.6%, the Euro has the biggest weight in the index followed by the JPY (13.6%), GBP (11.9%), CAD (9.1%), SEK (4.2%), and CHF (3.6%). Hence, a sharp decline in the EUR/USD pair could help the US Dollar Index rise even if the US Dollar weakens against some of the other currencies in the basket.  US Dollar F.A.Q. What is the US Dollar? The US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the 'de facto' currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according todatafrom 2022.Following the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world's reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away. How do the decisions of the Federal Reserve impact the US Dollar? The most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates.When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed's 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback. What is Quantitative Easing and how does it influence the US Dollar? In extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system.It is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed's weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar. What is Quantitative Tightening and how does it influence the US Dollar? Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing in new purchases. It is usually positive for the US Dollar. ",0

"A further Dollar decline looks likely this year, although economists at ING suspect this is more a story for the second half when theFedcan declare that the inflation battle is won. A case of when, not if the Dollar declines “The collapse of two regional banks in the US has seen the Fed take action to address financial stability, while at the same time tightening rates to address monetary stability. We expect these two positions to collide in the second half of this year, where tighter credit conditions and greater evidence of a hard landing could see the Fed cut rates 100 bp in 4Q23. It is a question of when not if the Dollar declines.” “We favour a 1.05-1.10 range over coming months. But the European financial sector looks better positioned than the US.

GBP/USD will struggle to sustain a move above 1.25 in the second quarter “Based on our EUR/USD view for the second quarter, we suspect GBP/USD may bounce around in a 1.20-1.25 range. Events in the US, however, give us greater conviction that it trades at 1.28/1.30 later in the year as the Fed pushes through with easing.” “An early pause from theBoEin May could also support the view thatGBP/USDwill struggle to sustain a move above 1.25 in the second quarter.” ",1
"The AUD/USD pair sticks to its intraday gains through the early part of the North American session and is currently placed around the 0.6660-0.6655 region, up nearly 0.25% for the day. TheUS Dollar(USD) meets with some supply and stalls a four-day-old recovery trend from over a two-month low touched last week, which, in turn, is seen pushing the AUD/USD pair higher. A generally positive tone around the equity markets is seen as a key factor undermining the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and lending some support to the risk-sensitiveAussie. The upside for the AUD/USD pair, however, remains capped amid signs that the post-COVID economic recovery in China was losing steam. The concerns were fueled by softer Chinese data, which showed that consumer inflation hit an 18-month low and producer price inflation contracted at a steady pace. This, in turn, acts as a headwind for the China-proxy Australian Dollar. Apart from this, speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may continue raising interestrates, for now, seem to have put a floor under the US Treasury bond yields. In fact, the current market pricing indicates a greater chance of another 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May. This lends some support to the USD and contributes to capping the AUD/USD pair, at least for now. Traders also seem reluctant to place aggressive bets ahead of the release of the latest US consumer inflation figures and the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday.

"Economists at ING expect steady outperformance of the Yen through the year and forecast USD/JPY at 128 by the end of June. The Bank of Japan can add to the Yen’s appeal “A lower USD/JPY is becoming the market’s conviction call. It covers both the potential for a sharpFedeasing cycle and frailty in the US financial system. Also, there is the wild card risk event of a change inBoJpolicy. “At the 16 June meeting, we think the BoJ could shorten its yield curve target to 5-year from 10-year JGB yields. 10-year JGB yields would rise sharply, and the Yen would rally.

"The EURUSD began the US session by testing both the 100 and 200 moving averages (blue and green lines - refer toearlier video).

Currently, the price is approaching a significant swing area ranging from 1.0925 to 1.09438. Examining the daily chart, we can observe that this swing area has historical significance. Although the price managed to breach and close above the upper end of this range in early February and once again earlier this month, it failed to maintain the momentum and retreated lower on the following day. For the bullish bias to strengthen, the price needs to not only rise above 1.09438 but also remain above this level.

Bulls are moving in following a close above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement measure which is bullish. A higher high could be on the cards for this bull cycle. However, the price is on the backside of the bull trendline which means the bull cycle has been decelerating. If bears commit heavily to the next bullish thrust, a period of distribution could unfold. 1.2270s will be key in this regard ahead of 1.2190. However, the above thesis is meanwhile bullish: GBP/USD H1 chart  On the lower time frames, such as this hourly chart, we can see the price is testing 1.2400 structure but so long as this holds, given the break of the trendline to the upside, a break of 1.2450 will likely leave the bulls in control for a run to test the 1.2520s. If on the other hand, considering the break of the prior bullish trendline, if bears commit below 1.2450, then a bearish thesis will be in play to break below 1.2400:  GBP/USD bullish scenario  However, the bullish thesis will be in play while above support and 1.2350 as per the above daily chart.

This follows a series of data leading up to the event on Wednesday, including Friday´sNonfarm Payrollsthat have added to expectations that the Federal Reserve will complete one more rate hike. The data showed that employers added 236,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. Consequently, The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by an additional 25 basis points at its May 2-3 meeting, before pausing in June. Markets are also pricing for the Fed pivot where a rate cut by year-end on could be on the cards to combat the risks of a recession.

"The EUR/USD pairhas shown a recovery move after a minor correction to near the round-level support of 1.0900 in the early Asian session. The major currency pair is looking to extend its recovery above the immediate resistance of 1.0928 as investors don’t seem anxious ahead of the release of the United States Inflation data. S&P500 remained choppy on Tuesday as technology stocks dragged on expectations of weaker revenue guidance. Investors are hoping for weak guidance from tech-savvystocksamid higher rates from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Also, recent banking turmoil could impact the quarterly result of the banking sector, portraying a cautious market mood. TheUS DollarIndex (DXY) has dropped to near 102.15 after failing to extend its recovery above 102.30. The USD Index is likely to extend its downside below the 102.00 support as investors have digested expectations of more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Meanwhile, the commentary from Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has also weighed on the US Dollar.Fedpolicymakers have advised a cautious approach as the combination of tight credit conditions and further restrictive monetary policy can hit sectors and regions differently than if monetary policy was acting on its own. For further guidance on the US Dollar, USConsumer Price Index(CPI) will be keenly watched. Analysts at Danske Bank expect “While lower energy prices will ease March headline inflation to around +0.2% MoM, we expect core inflation to remain elevated at +0.4%.” On theEurozonefront, monthly Retail Sales contracted by 0.8% as expected by investors. And, annual Retail Sales contracted by 3.0% while the street was anticipating more contraction to 3.5%. However,the European Central Bank (ECB)will keep on hikingratesdespite evidence of a decline in retail demand.

"""Euro zone inflation is at risk of getting entrenched above 2% so the European Central Bank will keep fighting excessive price growth, even as its policy response is shifting gears,"" said French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau late Tuesday per Reuters. Additional comments We now face the risk of entrenched inflation, which lies in the underlying or ‘core’ component. Inflation has become more widespread, and potentially more persistent. Monetary policy was most effective in tackling underlying or core inflation. I expect price growth back at around the ECB's 2% target by the end of 2024 or the end of 2025. We at the ECB are now moving from a 'sprint' to a 'long-distance race'. Inflation outlook, underlying inflation readings and the effectiveness of policy transmission will be the key factors in the next decisions.

Further, the National Australia Bank’s (NAB) Business Conditions matched the forecast figure of 16.0, versus 17.0 prior, whereas NAB Business Confidence eased to -1.0 versus 0.0% expected and -4.0% previous readings. On the same line, Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Tuesday, ""We reached an agreement with China to settle the dispute over Australian barley.” “China agreed to review the duties levied on Australian barley,” Wong added. Further, China’s ending of military strikes near Taiwan and mixed comments from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) officials also allowed the AUD/USD bulls to remain firmer. However, the market’s receding optimism towards further rate hikes and mixed comments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as softer China inflation, to prod the AUD/USD bulls.

Recently, PhiladelphiaFedPresident Patrick Harker said on Tuesday that the Federal Reserve will continue to look closely at available data to determine what, if any, additional actions they may need to take. Before him, Federal Reserve (Fed) Bank of New York President John Williams said that if inflation comes down, we will have to lower rates. Furthermore, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, said on Tuesday that they need to be cautious about raising interestratesafter recent development in the banking sector. On the other hand, Reuters said that China ended three days of military drills around Taiwan on Monday saying they had tested integrated military capabilities under actual combat conditions, having practiced precision strikes and blockading the island that Beijing views as its own. Elsewhere, IMF revised down global real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecast for 2023 to 2.8% from 2.9% in January's report.

"TheGBP/USDpair has rebounded to near 1.2430 in the early Asian session after defending the round-level support of 1.2400. The Cable is gathering strength for extending its rally amid an upbeat market mood ahead of the release of the United States inflation. An absence of anxiety among investors ahead of the USConsumer Price Index(CPI) indicates that investors have digested expectations of consecutive 25 basis points (bps) rate hike from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Despite knowing the fact that Wednesday’s inflation data carries higher value as it will be the last inflation data before May’s monetary policy meeting, investors are hammering theUS DollarIndex. The USD Index has turned sideways after a corrective move from 102.30 and is expected to test the critical support of 102.00. Apart from the US inflation data, the speech fromBank of England(BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey will be keenly watched. BoE Bailey is expected to provide guidance about the likely monetary policy action ahead. A hawkish guidance is expected from BoE Bailey amid an absence of evidence of United Kingdom inflation softening. GBP/USD is gathering strength to deliver a breakout of the Falling Channel formed on an hourly scale. The Cable is hovering near the edge of the upper portion of the aforementioned chart pattern. The asset looks confident above the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2420 as it indicates that the short-term trend is bullish. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is eyeing a decisive break above 60.00 for activation of the bullish momentum. For an upside move, the Cable needs to surpass April 11 high at 1.2457, which will trigger short coverings and will drive the major toward the psychological resistance of 1.2500 followed by April 04 high at 1.2525. On the flip side, a break below the round-level support of 1.2400 will expose the asset to April 10 low at 1.2344 and March 30 low at 1.2294. GBP/USD hourly chart  GBP/USD  ",1

In doing so, the Euro pair keeps the previous day’s U-turn from the lower line of a three-week-old rising wedge bearish chart pattern. However, the impending bear cross on the MACD and the quote’s multiple failures to remain firmer past 1.0900 teases EUR/USD sellers on a key day. That said, the pair’s pullback needs to conquer the stated bearish pattern’s support line, around 1.0870 at the latest, to confirm the rising wedge breakdown and lure the sellers. Following that, the 50-DMA support of near 1.0735 can act as an intermediate halt during the pair’s anticipated fall toward the theoretical target of around 1.0610. On the contrary, the monthly high of 1.0973 can lure theEUR/USDbulls but the upside remains elusive unless crossing the 1.1000-05 resistance confluence, including the stated wedge’s top line and the February 01 peak.

The Aussie asset is getting traction as theUS DollarIndex (DXY) has resumed its downside journey ahead of the release of the United StatesConsumer Price Index(CPI) data. The USD Index is likely to test the 102.00 cushion as investors are taking the release of US inflation casually. S&P500 futures are holding nominal gains after a sideways Tuesday, portraying anxiety ahead of the quarterly result season.

Medium-term guidance on US inflation from MinneapolisFedBank President Neel Kashkari is weighing on the US Dollar. Fed policymaker sees inflation at middle 3% by end of this year, closer to 2% next year. On the technical front, AUD/USD has delivered a breakdown of the Inverted Flag chart pattern formed on a four-hour scale. A breakdown of the Inverted Flag results in wider ticks and heavy volume towards the downside. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.6665 is acting as a barricade for the Aussie bulls. Contrary to that, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has shifted into the 40.00-60.00 range from the bearish range of 20.00-40.00. Going forward, more weakness will be observed on a breakdown of April 10 low at 0.6620, which will expose theAussieasset to March 10 low at 0.6564 followed by the round-level support at 0.6500. In an alternate scenario, a break above April 07 high at 0.6691 will drive the asset toward March 22 high at 0.6759.

In doing so, the Euro pair justifies the market’s cautious mood ahead of the key USConsumer Price Index(CPI) for March and the Minutes of the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Monetary Policy Meeting. Also challenging the pair buyers could be the recent mixed comments from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers.

However, S&P 500 Futures remain directionless around 4,138 after a mixed Wall Street close. Further, the US Treasury bond yields grind higher and prod theUS Dollarsellers. That said, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields grind higher around 3.43% and 4.03 during a four-day and five-day uptrend respectively.

However, an impending bull cross on the MACD indicator joins the GBP/USD pair’s successful trading above 100-SMA and an upward-sloping trend line from March 24 keeps the buyers hopeful. As a result, the bulls can ignore the latest inaction while keeping their eyes on the Year-To-Date (YTD) high of 1.2525, marked earlier in April.

"TheUSD/JPY pairhas printed a fresh four-week high at 134.04 in the Asian session. The upside bias for the asset is the outcome of a recovery in theUS DollarIndex (DXY) as investors have started turning anxious ahead of the release of the United States inflation data and the continuation of the Bank of Japan’s support to expansionary monetary policy. The USD Index is attempting to defend testing of the 102.00 support as investors are routinely getting nervous ahead of USConsumer Price Index(CPI). The demand for US government bonds continues to remain choppy ahead of US inflation. The yields on 10-year US Treasurybondsare hovering around 3.43%. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures have continued their sideways performance as investors are preferring a postponement of positions in equities ahead of the quarterly result season. Stock-specific action is highly likely in the S&P500 ahead. Analysts at Wells Fargo expect, “After rising 0.4% in February, we look for the CPI to moderate to a 0.2% gain in March. With the initial surge in oil/gasoline prices stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a full year behind us, CPI when measured on a year-over-year basis should fall to 5.1% in March from 6.0% in February. However, another elevated reading in the core CPI is likely to indicate that the recent trend in inflation is little improved. Excluding food and energy, we look for the CPI to rise 0.4% and remain close to 5% on a three-month annualized basis. On the Tokyo front, inflation expectations have been trimmed as the Producers Price Index (PPI) has been trimmed. Stagnant performance has been observed on a monthly basis as expected. While annual PPI softened further to 7.2% from the prior release of 8.0% but remained higher than the consensus of 7.1%. This conveys the inability of firms in hiking the prices of goods and services amid weaker retail demand despite an increase in wage growth. USD/JPY  ",1

We added, ‘breach of 1.0895 would suggest that 1.0830 is not coming back into view’. However, EUR did not retest 1.0830 as it rebounded from 1.0855 to 1.0927 before settling at 1.0910 (+0.47%).

A sell-off in theUS DollarIndex (DXY) on expectations that the United States inflation will decelerate quickly has bolstered bullish bias for the major currency pair. The USD Index has refreshed its day’s low at 102.02 and is expected to extend correction further as commentaries from Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers have infused fresh blood into the risk-sensitive currencies.

As per Refinitiv estimates, S&P500 are expected to report shrinkage in profits by 5.2% vs. a growth forecast of 1.4% anticipated at the start of the year. The downgraded forecast for S&P500 is backed by higherratesfrom theFedand tight credit conditions from US commercial banks, which have squeezed advances to firms. The USD Index is likely to be guided by the inflation data. Analysts at NBF expect “The energy component may have had a negative impact on the headline index as prices likely fell in both thegasolineand natural gas segment. Expected gains for shelter and used vehicles could still result in a 0.2% monthly increase in headline prices.

Strong inflation data today should therefore support the Dollar accordingly, as a further rate hike is increasingly being priced in by the market but not completely yet. I would be surprised though if the inflation data would cause EUR/USD to break out of its 1.08-1.10 range today.” “Whereas the Fed sees no scope for rate hikes this year the market expects lower Fedratesas early as the second half of the year presumably to counteract an excessive tightening of financing conditions. As today’s inflation rates are unlikely to affect this view any USD rally is likely to end early.” “We do not assume that the discrepancy between Fed and market expectations will end today or in the near future.

"TheUSD/JPY pairfalls from a four-week high on Wednesday after the release of US CPI showed an unexpected slowdown in inflation which increased expectations the Federal Reserve might put a brake on its aggressive rate-hiking agenda at its next meeting in May. TheUS Dollar(USD) languishes near the weekly low amid growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve (Fed) is nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle and this acts as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair. Apart from this, looming recession risks seem to benefit the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and further contribute to keeping a lid on the major. In fact, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday trimmed its 2023 global growth outlook, citing the impact of higher interestrates. That said, the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) dovish near-termoutlookcontinues to undermine the JPY and should help limit losses for the USD/JPY pair. It is worth recalling that the newBoJGovernor Kazuo Ueda said on Monday it was appropriate to maintain the ultra-loose stance as inflation has yet to hit 2% as a trend. In contrast, the current market pricing indicates a greater chance of a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May and the bets were lifted by the upbeatUS NFPreport. The US Consumer Prise Index in March came out at 0.1% MoM when a 0.3% rise had been forecast by economists. YoY the Index showed a rise of 5.0% when 5.2% had been expected from a previous 6.0% result. The data further reduced bets the Federal Reserve will hike rates at its nexrt policy meeting, which weighed on the US Dollar. Next on the data docket for Wednesday are the FOMC minutes, which will be looked upon for clues about the future rate-hike path and play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics. From a technical perspective, acceptance above 50 and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) could be seen as a fresh trigger for bulls, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the USD/JPY pair is to the upside. Hence, any meaningful corrective pullback is more likely to attract fresh buying at lower levels and remain limited, at least for the time being. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",0
"EUR/USDis enjoying some gentle support as investors return from their Easter break. US CoreCPIwill be the key event of the day and will determine whether the pair has a chance of breaking above 1.10, economists at ING report. 1.10 should prove a tough nut to crack “Two-year EUR:USD swap differentials are pretty steady at near 100 bps in favour of the Dollar. Perhaps we should not expect too much further narrowing now.” “Two-year US Treasury yields are already trading at a 100 bps discount to the Fed funds rate, a discount which could move to 125 bps if the Fed hikes in May. Historically, the 125-150 bps marks a deep historic discount for US two-year yields, and much substantial further downside for two-year yields may only emerge when theFedis ready or has started easing – probably in the fourth quarter.” “Our base case is that EUR/USD will struggle to sustain a break above 1.10 this quarter.” “EUR/USD to trade a 1.0900-1.0950 range into the pivotal US CPI release.” ",0
"The buying interest around the European currency remains well and sound and liftsEUR/USDfurther north of 1.0900 the figure on Wednesday. EUR/USD looks firm in pre-CPI trade EUR/USD advances for the second session in a row and looks to consolidate the recent breakout of the key 1.0900 barrier amidst the persistent selling pressure surrounding the greenback. Indeed, investors keep selling the dollar and favour further strength in the pair as speculation of another soft print in US inflation (due later) might reinforce the perception that the Fed could pause its hiking cycle in May. From the ECB, there are no changes so far to the idea of a most likely 25 bps rate in May, a view that continues to be propped up by hawkish comments from ECB’s rate-setters. Nothing scheduled data-wise in the old continent on Wednesday should leave the attention to the release of USCPIand the publication of the FOMC Minutes later in the NA session. What to look for around Euro The Euro advances beyond the 1.0900 hurdle versus the US Dollar in response to the renewed weakness in the buck and further recovery in the risk-linked complex. In the meantime, price action around the single currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the incipient Fed-ECB divergence when it comes to the banks’ intentions regarding the potential next moves in interest rates. Moving forward, hawkish ECB-speak continues to favour further rate hikes, although this view appears in contrast to some loss of momentum in economicfundamentalsin the region.

"The GBP/USD pair attracts some selling following an intraday uptick to the 1.2445 area and reverses a part of the previous day's strong move up. Spot prices drop to a fresh daily low during the early part of the European session, with bears now awaiting a sustained break below the 1.2400 round-figure mark before placing fresh bets. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) put a floor under the US Treasury bond yields and act as a tailwind for theUS Dollar(USD), which, in turn, is seen weighing on the GBP{/USD pair. In fact, markets have been pricing in a greater chance of another 25 bps rate hike at the next FOMC meeting in May. The bets were reaffirmed by the overnight hawkish comments by Philadelphia Fed Bank President Patrick Harker, saying that the US central bank is fully committed to bringing inflation back down to the 2% target. The British Pound, on the other hand, is pressured by the recent mixed signals from theBank of England(BoE) policymakers over the next move. Apart from this, looming recession risks seem to benefit the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and exert some downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. That said, growing acceptance that theFedis nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycles is holding back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets ahead of the release of the latest US consumer inflation figures and the FOMC meeting minutes later this Wednesday. Investors will look for clues about the Fed's future rate-hike path, which will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to theGBP/USDpair. Apart from this, the BoE Governor Andrew Bailey's scheduled speech should contribute to producing short-term trading opportunities ahead of the UK GDP report on Thursday. Nevertheless, the aforementioned fundamental backdrop favours bearish traders and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the downside.

"Today's US MarchConsumer Price Index(CPI) release will shed light on whether inflation has turned the corner or the Fed needs to tighten further. US March CPI to set the tone “Core US CPI has been one of the biggest FX movers over the last 12 months and today's March release is expected to show another sticky 0.4% MoM reading. Sticky inflation is probably the biggest risk to the consensus views in the FX market right now that EUR/USD and USD/JPY end the year at 1.12 and 125, respectively.” “Today sees the release of the 22 March FOMC minutes. Undoubtedly there will be a lot of noise in the minutes and it is unclear what they will mean for current market pricing of a final 25 bps hike in May (75% priced) and a subsequent 60 bps easing cycle by year-end.” “Expect DXY to be driven by any surprises on the MarchCPItoday and the sharper reaction (risk negative, Dollar rally) would probably come on an upside surprise.” See –US CPI: Banks Preview, inflation softening, good news on the horizon?",0
"The GBPUSD has moved to new highs as the buyers push toward the highs from last week. Those highs come between 1.2505 and 1.25246 (see red number circles on the chart above). With four separate highs in that area, there could be willing sellers with stops above the level at least on the first test. On the downside, the price moved away from a swing area between 1.24238 and 1.24472 after the US CPI data. The price is also extending away from its converged 100 and 200 hour moving averages which come near the low of that swing area. For buyers looking for more upside, it would take a move below those levels to increase the bearish bias (risk levels for bullish buyers).

"Extra weakness inGBP/USDshould meet a tough support level at 1.2275, according to UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “After GBP dropped to 1.2353 on Monday, we noted yesterday that ‘despite the decline, downward momentum has not improved much’. However, we were of the view that ‘there is scope for GBP to dip below 1.2345 before stabilization is likely’. GBP did not dip below 1.2345 but instead, rebounded to a high of 1.2449. The rapid bounce appears to be overdone and GBP is unlikely to advance much further. Today, GBP is more likely to trade in a range, expected to be between 1.2385 and 1.2455.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Two days ago (17 Apr, spot at 1.2405), we highlighted that GBP could edge lower but any decline is unlikely to break clearly below the major support at 1.2275. We continue to hold the same view even though after the rebound yesterday, the odds for GBP to decline have diminished. All in all, only a breach of 1.2475 (no change in ‘strong resistance’ level) would indicate that the downside bias has faded.”",1
"TheUSD/JPY paironce again shows some resilience below the 134.00 round-figure mark for the second straight day and attracts fresh buyers on Wednesday. The intraday positive move picks up pace during the early European session and lifts spot prices to a nearly three-week high, around the 134.75 region in the last hour, though lacks follow-through. A further rise in the US Treasury bond yields helps revive theUS Dollar(USD) demand, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor acting as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. In fact, the yield on the two-year US Treasury note and the benchmark 10-year US government bond climb to over a four-week high amid speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will continue raising interestrates. The bets were lifted by the hawkish remarks by Fed officials. In fact, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Friday that a year of aggressive rate hikes ""haven't made much progress"" in returning inflation to their 2% target and the central bank still needs to move rates higher. Adding to this, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, in an interview on Tuesday, backed the case for additional 75 bps of tightening against the market consensus for one more 25 bp hike next month and then the potential for cuts later this year. Adding to this, the incoming positive US macro data pointed to a resilient economy and fueled concerns that the Fed may have more work to do, which, in turn, remains supportive of elevated US Treasury bond yields. This results in the widening of the US-Japan rate differential. Apart from this, the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) dovish stance undermines the Japanese Yen (JPY) and pushes the USD/JPY pair higher, though the risk-off impulse could cap gains. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed fuel worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs. This, in turn, tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets, which is evident from a fresh leg down in the equity markets and tends to benefit traditional safe-haven currencies, including the JPY. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for some follow-through buying before positioning for any further appreciating move. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",1
"TheGBP/USDpair reverses an early European session dip to the 1.2400 mark and turns positive for the second successive day on Wednesday. Spot prices, however, retreat a few pips from a fresh weekly high touched in the last hour and currently trade near the mid-1.2400s, still up around 0.20% for the day. The British Pound strengthens across the board following the release of stronger UK consumer inflation figures and turns out to be a key factor pushing the GBP/USD pair higher. In fact, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the headline UK CPI eased less than expected, to the 10.1% YoY rate in March from 10.4% in the previous month. Furthermore, the Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy items, held steady at 6.2% YoY during the reported month against expectations for a slide to 6.0%. The stubbornly high inflation comes on the back of the stronger UK wage growth data on Tuesday and should keep pressure on theBank of England(BoE) to raise interestratesfurther. In fact, the markets now see over a 90% chance of a 25-bps rate hike in May, which, in turn, is seen benefitting the Sterling Pound. That said, the emergence of someUS Dollar(USD) buying is holding back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the GBP/USD pair and keeping a lid on any further gains, at least for the time being. The messages from several Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers have been very hawkish lately and support prospects for further tightening by the US central bank. This allows the US Treasury bond yields to prolong the recent upward trajectory and touch a fresh multi-week high, which, in turn, helps revive the USD demand. Apart from this, a generally weaker tone around the equity markets further seems to benefit the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and contributes to capping the upside for the GBP/USD pair. In the absence of any relevant market-movingeconomic datafrom the US on Wednesday, investors will focus on the release of the Fed’s Beige Book, due later during the US session, for the central bank’s take on the state of the US economy. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, will influence the USD and provide some impetus to the GBP/USD pair. Nevertheless, the aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before placing aggressive directional bets. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",1

Key quotes: “The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) paused its hiking cycle in March following the banking sector uncertainty. After the strong March employment data, markets now price in around 70% probability of one more hike over the summer, which we consider fair.” “With the global growth backdrop remaining weak and central banks broadly still on a tightening bias, theoutlookfor AUD/USD remains modestly negative.

"The GBP/USD pair is oscillating in a narrow range of around 1.2440 in the Asian session. Investors are divided on supportingthe PoundSterling or the US Dollar as the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BoE), both are expected to announce one more rate hike to continue weighing pressure on persistent inflation in respective economies. S&P500 settled Wednesday’s session with nominal losses after Tesla missed margins due to price cuts, however, production guidance remains steady, portraying a caution in the overall market mood.The US Dollar Index(DXY) is facing barricades while reclaiming the immediate resistance of 102.00. The USD Index saw a heavy correction after testing a weekly high of 102.20 as the release of the Fed’s Beige Book failed in fueling fresh blood in the former. Data collected in the Fed’s Beige Book were limited to April 10, which showed that stagnant or nominal growth has been registered in the majority of districts. Lending volumes and loan demand generally declined across consumer and business loan types. Several Districts noted that banks tightened lending standards amid increased uncertainty and concerns about liquidity. This has restricted the upside in the USD Index as the absence of growth and lower advances could impact overall economic activities ahead. On the United Kingdom front, the inflation report released on Wednesday showed that UK’s inflation is extremely persistent and is not ready to surrender space above a double-digit figure. Food price inflation has been registered as highest in the 45 years at 19.1%. Shortages of labor and energy crisis have been major drivers of heavily stubborn inflation. Following the latest UK inflation reading, analysts at Standard Chartered see theBank of Englandraising the key interest rate by 25 basis points in May. They further added, “Beyond May, we see the potential for additional hikes, but we think the MPC will take a meeting-by-meeting approach and decisions will be heavily dependent on howeconomic dataevolve month-to-month.” GBP/USD  ",0
"AUD/USD eases back towards 0.6700, around 0.6715 by the press time, as cautious markets weigh on the risk barometer pair ahead of the top-tier data/events on Thursday.  That said, the mostly downbeat sentiment and firmer US Treasury bond yields weighed on theAussiepair the previous day amid fears of inflation and geopolitical tensions. A notable jump in the inflation numbers at the key global economies joined the hawkish comments from the top-tier central bank officials renewed fears of higherratesand recession, which in turn renewed the US Dollar’s haven demand on Wednesday. Adding strength to therisk aversioncould be the war fears emanating from China and Russia. However, upbeat headlines from the Dragon Nation and an absence of any impressive US data tamed the AUD/USD pair’s run-up afterward. Recently, the UK,Eurozoneand the US have all been flashing upbeat signals for inflation while the central bank officials from theBank of England(BoE), European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) are all favoring higher rates for longer. The same raises the fears of economic slowdown especially when the ex-inflation numbers haven’t been too impressive and the Russia-Ukraine war takes a toll on the global economy. On the same line could be the Reuters’ news suggesting that US consumers are starting to fall behind on their credit card and loan payments as the economy softens. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and Atlanta Fed President Raphael W. Bostic were the latest hawkish Fed speakers who rekindled the “higher for longer” scenario for rates and favored theUS Dollar, as well as yields. Talking about geopolitics, UK’s warned Russian hackers targeting Western critical infrastructure while the US House China Committee discussed the Taiwan invasion scenario. Furthermore, the likely drag on the US debt ceiling decision is due to US President Joe Biden’s hesitance in lifting debt limits. Additionally, Bloomberg released news suggesting China’s role in the Russia-Ukraine war, which in turn adds strength to the risk-off mood. On the contrary, China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the state planner, said on Wednesday, the country is formulating plans to boost the recovery and expansion of consumption. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed mixed but the top-tier US Treasury bond yields refreshed monthly high and allowed the US Dollar to remain firmer. Moving on, National Australia Bank’s (NAB) Business Confidence for the first quarter (Q1), expected 2 versus -1 expected, will precede Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe’s independent review of the central bank to guide intraday moves of the AUD/USD pair.

"GBP/USDremains pressured around 1.2430, printing minor losses amid Thursday’s Asian session after a two-day uptrend. In doing so, the Cable pair stays on the bear’s radar amid multiple failures to cross the previous support line stretched from late March. Adding strength to the downside bias could be the sluggish MACD signals and steady RSI (14) line. However, the 100-SMA and a one-month-old resistance line, respectively near 1.2400 and 1.2370, restrict the GBP/USD pair’s short-term downside. It’s worth noting that a short-term horizontal line around 1.2350 holds the key to the GBP/USD pair’s slump toward the monthly low of 1.2275. Following that, the late March swing low near 1.2190 and the 1.2000 round figure will gain the market’s attention. On the flip side, a clear upside break of the 1.2470 support-turned-resistance will be enough for the GBP/USD buyers to retake control. In that case, the 1.2500 round figure and the monthly high of near 1.2550 should gain major attention before directing the Cable pair buyers towards the May 2022 high of near 1.2665.

"AUD/USD holds lower grounds as sellers attack the 0.6700 round figure early Thursday, after breaking short-term key support the previous day. In doing so, the Aussie pair takes clues from downbeat Australian data and justifies the market’s risk-off mood while paying a little heed to the latest action from the People’s Bank of China and Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)Governor Philip Lowe. National Australia Bank’s (NAB) Business Confidence for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023 came in at -4 versus 2 expected and -1 prior. Before that, the PBOC matched market forecasts of holding one-year and five-year Loan PrimeRates(LPRs) unchanged at 3.65% and 4.30% in that order. It’s worth noting that Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers and RBA Governor Lowe offered a fresh review of the RBA and signaled fewer numbers of meetings while allowing theAussiecentral bank to ignore Treasury’s decision. The moves failed to trigger any major market reaction as traders are more interested in inflation and geopolitical headlines amid the broad risk-off mood. While portraying the sentiment, S&P 500 Futures snap three-day winning streak at around 4,168 whereas the US 10-year and two-year bond coupons grind higher after refreshing the monthly top the previous day.

"The GBP/USD pair is displaying a back-and-forth action above 1.2420 in the Asian session. The Cable has turned sideways amid subdued performance bythe US Dollar Index(DXY). The USD Index is struggling to find a decisive direction amid an absence of a potential trigger. However, a sheer volatility contraction in the USD Index is expected to deliver explosive moves ahead. Market sentiment seems negative as the S&P500 futures have registered losses in the Asian session. The 500-US stock basket futures have settled on a mildly negative note in the past two trading sessions, however, a stock-specific action remained elevated due to the quarterly results season. Investors are worried that firms are forced to squeeze their revenue guidance due to higher interestratesfrom the Federal Reserve (Fed). Also, declining loans and advances to consumers and businesses by United States banks after the banking turmoil are expected to put extreme pressure on the working capital requirements of firms. Onthe PoundSterling front, the synergic effect of higher Average Hourly Earnings and double-digit headline inflation would not allow theBank of England(BoE) for consideration of pausing the policy-tightening spell. The major driver of sticky United Kingdom inflation is the rising food prices. UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that food inflation has printed a fresh 45-year high of 19.1%. This week, UK Retail Sales (March) data will be keenly watched. Monthly Retail Sales data is expected to contract by 0.5% vs. an acceleration of 1.2% reported in February. While annual Retail Sales would show a contraction of 3.1% against the 3.5% contraction shown earlier. A contraction in retail demand would provide some relief to the BoE policymakers. GBP/USD  ",0
"AUD/USD is displaying a sideways performance in a narrow range of the round-level resistance of 0.6700 in the early European session. TheAussieasset is consolidating after a mild correction move. The Australian Dollar didn’t show any major move as expected after the announcement of the interest rate decision by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). S&P500 futures are constantly adding losses in the Asian session as missed earnings from Netflix weighed on market sentiment. Meanwhile, Investors are worried that firms are coming with poor revenue guidance as interestratesby the Federal Reserve (Fed) have sky-rocketed and now United States banks are going extremely tight on loan disbursement to maintain asset quality. The events are cementing a slowdown in the US economy as firms would face a significant impact of the liquidity crisis. The US Dollar Index(DXY) is showing a subdued performance as the upside is capped and the downside is restricted in a range of 101.93-102.04. Following the footprints of the subdued USD Index, the US Treasury yields are also displaying a lackluster performance. Yields on 10-year US Treasury bonds seem stable above 3.59%. Fed’s Beige Book conveys consistent activities and tight credit conditions by US Investors were gauging reasons in Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book that would be supportive to force the Federal Reserve to consider an early pause to the policy-tightening spell. Except for tight credit conditions by US commercial banks, all economicindicatorswere favoring more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Fed Beige Book released on April 19 was the first after the collapse of US regional banks and it showed how worried banks are about their asset quality. Lending volumes and loan demand generally declined across consumer and business loan types. Several districts noted that banks tightened lending standards amid increased uncertainty and concerns about liquidity. Going forward, a synergic effect of further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and tight standards for credit disbursement by US banks would weigh heavily on US inflationary pressures. On the interest rate guidance, A Reuters poll on Fed’s interest rate guidance conveys that Fed chair Jerome Powell will deliver a final 25-basis-point interest rate increase in May and then hold rates steady for the rest of 2023. The survey also supports a short and shallow recession this year. This week, preliminary US S&P PMI data will remain in the spotlight. The street is anticipating the Manufacturing PMI at 49.0, lower than the former release of 49.2. The Services PMI is also seen lower at 51.5 against the figure of 52.6 released earlier. Australian Dollar remains muted despite unchanged PBoC’s policy A power-pack action was expected from the Australian Dollar amid the announcement of the interest rate decision by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). However, the Australian Dollar remained mute despite the People’s Bank of China holding its Loan Prime Rate (LPR) steady. China’s central bank has kept its one-year and five-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) stable at 3.65% and 4.30% respectively. An unchanged monetary policy stance by the People’s Bank of China was already expected by the market participants. Considering the fact that the Chinese economy is well on track for economic recovery after dismantling its pandemic controls, there was no urgency of easing monetary policy further. This week, theGross Domestic Product(GDP) released for the first quarter remained critically upbeat. In the first quarter, China’s growth rate remained in line with estimates at 2.2%. On an annual basis, the growth rate jumped by 4.5% vs. consensus of 4.0% and the former release of 2.9%. It is worth noting that Australia is a leading trading partner of China and higher growth prospects in China would be supportive of the Australian Dollar. Going forward, Friday’s preliminary Australian S&P PMI data will be keenly watched. As per the consensus, Manufacturing PMI will drop to 48.8 from the former release of 49.1. AUD/USD technical outlook  AUD/USD is auctioning in an Inverted Flag chart pattern which is a trend continuation pattern in which a long consolidation is followed by a breakdown. Usually, the consolidation phase of the chart pattern serves as an inventory adjustment in which those participants initiate shorts, which prefer to enter an auction after the establishment of a bearish bias and current sellers add more positions.

"Citing five sources familiar with the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) thinking, Reuters reported on Thursday, is open to mulling over the idea of making adjustments to its controversial bond yield control policy later this year. Key takeaways “The preferred approach, for now, is to stay the course, which means the bank will make no major immediate changes to YCC and its dovish policy guidance.” ""Given looming overseas economic risks, it's appropriate to maintain ultra-loose monetary policy now.” ""TheBOJmust avoid dampening public sentiment"" by sending a message that could be interpreted as an early approach of an exit.” ""Japan's wage dynamics appear to be changing.

"USD/JPY aptly portrays the market’s inaction during early Thursday as traders await more clues to extend the latest run-up. That said, the Yen pair seesaws around 134.80, recently retreating from a six-week high marked the previous day. Recently weighing on the Yen pair could be the headlines from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) as it maintains the overall upbeat economic assessment for seven of Japan's nine regions. Furthermore, chatters that theBoJcan tweak the Yield Curve Control (YCC) policy if wage momentum holds, favored by Reuters, weigh on the USD/JPY prices. It should be noted that the latest Fed Beige Book said, “Overall economic activity was little changed in recent weeks.” The report also mentioned that expectations for future growth were mostly unchanged as well. On a broader front, the looming fears of economic recession, backed by hawkish signals from the major central banks, seem to propel the US Treasury bond yields and theUS Dollarthe previous day. Late Wednesday, New York Fed President John Williams marked support for a 0.25% interest rate hike in May while saying, “Inflation is still too high, and we will use our monetary policy tools to restore price stability.” Just before him was ChicagoFederal Reserve BankPresident Austan Goolsbee who highlighted credit market strength as one of the key catalysts to watch ahead of the next Fed monetary policy meeting. Amid these plays, CME’s FedWatch Tool suggests that the market players place higher bets on the US central bank’s 0.25% rate hike in May, almost 85% at the latest, as well as reduce the probability of witnessing a rate cut in 2023. That said, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields grind near 3.60% and 4.25% respectively after refreshing the monthly top the previous day. Elsewhere, geopolitical concerns surrounding China, Russia and the US also put a floor under the USD/JPY prices, due to the US Dollar’s haven demand. However, the recently mixed US data and doubt about the Fed’s future rate hike trajectory prod the Yen pair buyers. As a result, the traders may closely observe today’s second-tier US data and comments from the Fed officials during their final round of public appearances before the blackout period for clear directions. Additionally, Friday’s Japan inflation data and the US PMIs are crucial for fresh impulse.

A combination of factors continues to act as a tailwind for theUS Dollar(USD), which, in turn, is seen exerting some downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed), along with a weaker rise sentiment, lend some support to the safe-haven Greenback.

The markets now seem convinced that the US central bank will lift rates by 25 bps at the next policy meeting in May and have been pricing in a small chance of another rate hike in June. The bets were reaffirmed by the recent hawkish comments by several Fed officials. Moreover, the incoming macro data from the US pointed to a resilient economy and fueled concerns that the Fed may have more work to do to tame stubbornly high inflation in the US amid easing fears of a full-blown banking crisis. This further fuel worries about the economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs and tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets., which is evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets. The anti-risk lends additional support to the safe-haven Greenback and weighs on the GBP/USD pair. That said, the stronger UK inflation figures released on Wednesday should keep pressure on the BoE to raise interestratesfurther and act as a tailwind for spot prices. The aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before placing aggressive bearish bets around the GBP/USD pair in the absence of any relevant macro data from the UK. The US economic docket features the release of the usual Weekly InitialJobless Claims, the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index and Existing Home Sales.

Despite the current bias favoring buyers, traders may be skeptical. Successful trading relies on making educated guesses and leveraging both fundamental and technical analysis. While the UK's stubbornly high inflation rate of 10.1% – unmatched by any other major country – and the US's 5% CPI should theoretically bolster the GBPUSD, buyers failed to capitalize on this earlier today. Similarly, the initial ascent above the 100/200-hour moving averages should have driven the pair higher, but this move quickly faltered, resulting in a sharp decline. Although a swing area provided support during the downward movement, the subsequent climb back above the 200/100-hour moving averages was unexpected, but it has happened.

A fresh wave of the global risk-aversion trade boosts demand for traditional safe-haven assets and benefits the Japanese Yen (JPY). Apart from this, a modestUS Dollar(USD) downtick, led by the ongoing pullback in the US Treasury bond yields from a nearly one-month high touched on Thursday, acts as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair. Meanwhile, an intraday decline in the US bond yields narrows the US-Japan rate differential and lends additional support to the JPY.

Apart from this, the risk-off impulse – as depicted by a generally weaker tone around the equity markets – benefits the safe-haven Greenback and contributes to capping the risk-sensitiveAussie. This makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before positioning for any further near-term appreciating move. Market participants now look to the US economic docket, featuring the Weekly InitialJobless Claimsand the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, for some trading impetus.

"The GBP/USD pair reverses an intraday dip to the 1.2400 round-figure mark and turns positive for the third successive day on Thursday. The pair, however, remain below the weekly high touched on Wednesday and trades around the 1.2450-1.2455 region, just below the weekly high touched on Wednesday. The US Treasury bond yields stall the recent strong rally to a nearly one-month high, which, along with the disappointing US macro data, exerts some pressure on theUS Dollar(USD). Apart from this, rising bets for another 25 bps rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) in May underpin the British Pound and act as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair. That said, the prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) should help limit the downside for the US bond yields. Furthermore, the risk-off impulse - as depicted by a generally weaker tone around the equity markets - could revive demand for the safe-haven Greenback and keep a lid on any meaningful gains for the GBP/USD pair. From a technical perspective, spot prices this week found a decent support near the 1.2355-1.2350 region. The said area should now act as a pivotal point, which if broken might prompt some technical selling. The GBP/USD pair could then slide to the 1.2300 mark en route to the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), just below the 1.2200 round figure. On the flip side, bulls might wait for some follow-through buying beyond the overnight swing high, around the 1.2470-1.2475 region, before placing fresh bets. TheGBP/USDpair might then surpass the 1.2500 psychological mark and then aim back to retesting the monthly swing high, around the 1.2545 region touched last week. The momentum could get extended towards the 1.2600 round figure, above which spot prices could climb to the next relevant hurdle near the 1.2660-1.2665 region.

"The Euro (EUR) trades marginally higher in the 1.0970s versus theUS Dollar(USD) after Wall Street's opening bell on Thursday. More broadly, the pair has pulled back from the recent April 14 highs of 1.1075 as the US Dollar recovers on bets the Federal Reserve (Fed) will continue raising interestrates.From a technical perspective, the Euro-Dollar pair is in a medium-term uptrend which is biased to extend. Scoping in, price action appears to be tracing out a triangle pattern which looks almost complete. EUR/USD Market Movers EUR/USD technical analysis: Overall still trending up EUR/USD has been rising in a medium-term uptrend since reversing at the September 2022 lows, and this established trend is likely to continue. After a pullback in February 2023,EUR/USDrecouped its losses during March and made new year-to-date highs above 1.1000 on April 13. EUR/USD: Daily Chart Drilling down to the 4-hour chart (below) and price action can be seen trading with steadily diminishing volatility in the mid 1.09s. It could be tracing out a triangle pattern which will eventually break out either higher or lower. Triangles are usually composed of five waves and the current wave looks like it might be the final 5th wave. If so, then a breakout is close at hand. EUR/USD: 4-hr Chart The Chaikin Money Flow oscillator, an indicator that is supposed to help give clues as to the eventual direction of a breakout from a range bound market, has been below the zero-line during most of the evolution of the triangle, suggesting a slight bias towards expecting a downside break. If price pierces below 1.0909 it would probably confirm the triangle was breaking lower whilst a breach of the 1.0999 April 17 high that it was higher. More broadly, a break and daily close above the 1.1075 year-to-date highs of April 14 would provide Euro bulls with added confidence to push price up to the next target at around 1.1190, where the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) is situated and likely to provide pushback. From a bearish perspective, a break and close below the lower high at 1.0830 would bring into question the strength and validity of the uptrend and could see losses extend down to a confluence of support at 1.0750. Euro FAQs What is the Euro? The Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, itaccountedfor 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day.EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world,accountingfor an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%). What is the ECB and how does it impact the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy.The ECB’s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates – or the expectation of higher rates – will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa.The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. How does inflation data impact the value of the Euro? Eurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB’s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control.Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money. How does economic data influence the value of the Euro? Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency.A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall.Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone’s economy. How does the Trade Balance impact the Euro? Another significant data release for the Euro is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period.If a country produces highly sought after exports then its currency will gain in value purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance. ",1

"EUR/USD advances, trimming some of its Wednesday’s losses after data from the United States (US) displays further economic deterioration, which reignited recession fears. Hence, investors seeking safety bought the Euro (EUR) to the detriment of the US Dollar (USD). The EUR/USD trades at 1.0969, above its opening price by 0.14%. EUR/USD boosted by a weaker US economy Wall Street continues to trade with losses amidst growing concerns of an impending recession in the United States. The latest round of data pointed to a deceleration in the economy, though US Federal Reserve (Fed) officials had reiterated that a recession is not their base scenario. The US economic calendar revealed that InitialJobless Claimsfor the week ending on April 15 rose by 245K, exceeding estimates of 240K, as data from the Department of Labor (DoL) showed. At the same time, the Philadelphia Fed reported that manufacturing activity decelerated in the mid-Atlantic region, with the manufacturing index plunging -31.3 beneath March’s -23.3, a headwind for the American Dollar (USD). The latest round of US data was that Existing Home Sales dropped 2.4% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 4.44 million in March. Despite the above, theCME FedWatch Toolstill displays that the swaps markets expect a 25 bps hike at the May meeting, with odds at 88.6%, despite falling US Treasury bond yields. Consequently,the US Dollar Index, a measure of the buck’s value vs. a basket of six currencies, is down 0.20%, at 101.739. Of late, the Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester is crossing newswires and said she’s happy with the progress made on inflation. Still, inflation is too high and foresees higher interest rates. On theEurozone(EU), European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers continued their round of crossing newswires led by its President ChristineLagarde, saying that inflation is too strong, added that the central bank needs to do “all they can” to bring inflation to the 2% target. Earlier, Klass Knot said that the ECB might need to raiseratesin June and July on top of a 25 bps hike in May. EUR/USD Technical Analysis  From a daily chart perspective, theEUR/USD remainssupported by the 20-day EMA from March 20 until today. As the EUR/USD dipped toward the 20-day EMA at 1.0903, the pair jumped and recorded a new cycle high. Should this be the case, the 1.1100 is up for grabs, but EUR buyers must reclaim the psychological 1.1000, followed by the YTD high at 1.1075. Conversely, a fall below 1.0900 will expose the 20-day EMA at 1.0896. If EUR/USD drops below the latter, a dive to 1.0800 is on the cards. EUR/USD  ",0

Data on Thursday revealed that the United Kingdom´s inflation is far more persistent and the highest in Western Europe. Headline inflation dropped to 10.1% in March from February's 10.4%. However, this was above expectations for the forecasted drop to 9.8%.

GBP/USD has been tracking rate differentials closely since November (after the chaos of the previous weeks).´´ However, there is a concern over the impact of high prices on households and businesses which is stalling the bid inthe PoundSterling. For instance, real wages in Britain, earnings adjusted for inflation, recently showed one of the biggest drops on record in the three months to February, with a fall of 4.1% year on year. Nevertheless, money markets are pricing in rates peaking at around 5% in November this year vs. last month's expectation of around 4.00%. ´´I struggle with the idea that the UK will have higher rates than the US by the end of this year,´´ Kit Juckes, an economist at Societe Generale said. ´´The idea that the MPC will act three more times before pausing seems implausible even if they are worried that they have done too little so far. And if there is a pause, then a US-led slowdown will probably prevent the hikes re-starting (if there is no US slowdown, the Fed won’t be easing),´´ Juckes argued, adding: ´´The repricing of UK supports Sterling as long as rates, and not growth, drive FX, but I fear the positive impact of the ratesoutlookfor GBP/USD will fade long before.´´ GBP/USD  ",0

TheAussieasset displayed a steep rise on Thursday after Zou Lan, head of monetary policy, at People Bank of China (PBOC) reaffirmed on Thursday that the central bank “will continue implementing prudent monetary policy.” S&P500 witnessed a steep fall on Thursday after Tesla failed to cheer market participants from its quarterly earnings. The 500-US stock basket delivered a third consecutive bearish closing, portraying arisk aversiontheme. Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla reported the lowest quarterly gross margins in two years as the firm is on the path of slashingrates. The firm signaled that more price declines are in pipeline. The US Dollar Index(DXY) showed a wild gyration in the 101.63-102.13 range and went back inside the woods. The release of the weeklyjobless claimsconfirmed that United States labor market conditions are loosening swiftly and firms are postponing their recruitment plans.

"The EUR/USD pairhas rebounded from 1.0960 after a corrective move but is inside the woods as investors are awaiting the release of the preliminary Eurozone/United States S&P PMI data (April). The major currency pair has remained in a range of 1.0911-1.1000 from the past two trading sessions as the FX domain is preparing for the pre-anxiety move ahead of a monetary policy decision from the Federal Reserve (Fed). S&P500 settled on a negative note consecutively for the third day amid sheer volatility inspired by quarterly result season. Weak earnings from Tesla weighed heavily on market sentiment on Thursday. Also, poor revenue guidance due to the consideration of lowering prices cautioned market participants. The impact of higher interestratesby the Fed is clearly visible in the quarterly earnings show. As per Refinitiv data, analysts have largely retained last week's expectations of a near 5% YoY fall in quarterly profits of companies in the 500-US stocks basket. The US Dollar Index(DXY) is defending the critical support of 101.60 for the past few trading sessions. The USD Index also defended the aforementioned support on Thursday despite the release of downbeatJobless claimsdata. The US Department of Labor reported a jump in the number of Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending April 04 at 245K, higher than the estimates and the former release of 240K. Accelerating jobless claims cemented fears of easing labor market conditions. However, Fed policymakers are still confident of more rate hikes from the central bank.

On theEurozonefront, preliminary Consumer Confidence (April) improved to -17.5 from the expectations of -18.5 and the former release of -19.2. This could be the outcome of a consistent decline in inflationary pressures after enormous efforts fromthe European Central Bank (ECB). EUR/USD  ",0
"TheUSD/JPY pairhas defended the crucial support of 134.00 in the Asian session despite the release of wider-than-anticipated Japan’sNational Consumer Price Index(CPI) data. Annual national CPI (March) has accelerated to 3.2% from the consensus of 2.6% but remained lower than the prior release of 3.3%. A marginal decline in headline CPI from prior figures is the outcome of declining oil prices in the international market. The core PCI that strips off the impact of volatile oil and food prices has jumped to 3.8% vs. the estimates of 3.4% and the former release of 3.5%. This indicates a sign of a consistent jump in retail demand, supported by the continuation of ultra-loose monetary policy and stimulus for raising wages. This indicates that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is well on track of keeping the inflation rate steadily above 2%. Earlier, BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda cited that the central bank is expected to attain steady consumer prices above 2% in 2025. On Thursday, Reuters reported that the BoJ is open to mulling over the idea of making adjustments to its controversial bond yield control policy later this year. Sources familiar to theBoJalso cited “The preferred approach, for now, is to stay the course, which means the bank will make no major immediate changes to YCC and its dovish policy guidance.” Meanwhile,the US Dollar Index(DXY) is showing topsy-turvy moves around 101.80 amid anxiety ahead of preliminary S&P PMI data.

"The GBP/USD pair comes under some selling pressure on the last day of the week and maintains its offered tone through the early European session. The pair currently trades around the 1.2425-1.2420 region, down over 0.15% for the day, and reacts little to the latest UK macro data. The UK Office for National Statistics reported this Friday that domestic Retail Sales contracted more-than-expected, by 0.9% in March and reversed a major part of the rise recorded in the previous month. Furthermore, sales excluding fuel also missed consensus estimates and dropped by 1% during the reported month as compared to the 1.4% rise reported in February. This, in turn, undermines the British Pound, which, along with a modestUS Dollar(USD) uptick, acts as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed), along with a softer risk tone, lend some support to the safe-haven Greenback. In fact, the markets seem convinced that the Federal Reserve will raiseratesby 25 bps in May and have been pricing in a small chance of another rate hike in June, bolstered by the recent hawkish remarks by FOMC officials. This raises worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs, which tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets. The downside for the GBP/USD pair, however, seems cushioned, at least for the time being, amid rising bets for an additional interest rate hike by theBank of England(BoE). Against the backdrop of stronger UK wage growth data released earlier this week, the stubbornly high inflation should keep pressure on the BoE to raise interest rates further. This makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before confirming that this week's bounce from the 1.2350 strong horizontal support has run out of steam. Nevertheless, the GBP/USD pair remains on track to register modest weekly gains as market participants now look forward to the release of the flash PMI prints from the UK and the US for a fresh impetus. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, will influence the USD price dynamics and produce short-term trading opportunities around theGBP/USDpair heading into the weekend.

"The USD/JPY pair drifts lower for the second successive day on Friday and drops to a four-day low, around the 133.70 region during the early part of the European session. A combination of factors provides a goodish lift to the Japanese Yen (JPY), which, in turn, drags the USD/JPY pair away from a multi-week high, around the 135.10-135.15 region touched on Wednesday. According to the data released earlier this Friday, Japan’sNational Consumer Price Index(CPI) ticked down to a 3.2% YoY rate in March from 3.3% previous. This, however, was well above the 2.6% estimated and the Bank of Japan’s target range. Furthermore, the Core CPI, which excludes volatile oil and food prices, accelerated to a 3.8% YoY rate from 3.5% in February, surpassing expectations for a reading of 3.4%. This, in turn, indicates broadening price pressure in the world's third-largest economy and keeps alive expectations that theBoJcould begin to phase out its massive stimulus programme later this year. Apart from this, a generally weaker tone around the equity markets benefits the JPY's relative safe-haven status and contributes to the offered tone surrounding the USD/JPY pair. Investors remain worried about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs, which, in turn, take its toll on the global risk sentiment. Meanwhile, the flight to safety leads to a further slide in the US Treasury bond yields, resulting in the narrowing of the US-Japan rate differential and lending additional support to the JPY. That said, growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will continue raising interestratesacts as a tailwind for theUS Dollar(USD) and could help limit the downside for the major. This, in turn, warrants some caution for aggressive bearish trades before positioning for any meaningful intraday fall. Traders now look forward to the release of the flash PMI prints from the US, due later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields, will influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to theUSD/JPY pair. Apart from this, the broader risk sentiment will drive demand for the safe-haven JPY and contribute to producing short-term trading opportunities on the last day of the week.

Still around the ECB, Board member Visco called for some prudence when it comes to price in further interest rate increases, while his colleague De Guindos showed some confidence in that core prices will eventually lose traction, at the time when he reiterated that future decisions on the interest rate will remain data dependent.

However, USD pulled back directly to a low of 134.00. The pullback in USD could extend but a break of the strong support level at 133.50 is unlikely. On the upside, a breach of 134.75 (minor resistance is at 134.40) would indicate that USD is not weakening further.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our update from yesterday (20 Apr, spot at 134.65) still stands. As highlighted, the bias is still towards a higher USD. The next level to aim for is a 135.75. Overall, only a break of 133.50 (no change in ‘strong support’ level) would indicate that the USD strength that started on Monday (17 Apr, spot at 133.80) has run its course.”",1
"The Euro (EUR) is falling sharply against its biggest counterpart, theUS Dollar(USD), during the early US session on Friday. The release of better-than-expected US S&P GlobalPMIdata has helped chase away recession fears and is supporting USD. With the banking crisis now seemingly in the rear-view mirror the focus is back on the fight with inflation, and both currencies are benefiting from expectations of higher interestrates. More broadly,the EUR/USD pairappears to be undergoing a correction after making new year-to-date highs of 1.1075 on April 14. From a technical perspective, the Euro-Dollar pair is in a medium-term uptrend which is expected to continue once the correction has finished. Scoping in, the steadily diminishing volatility on intraday charts is tracing out a triangle pattern, which suggests there will be a breakout move on the horizon. EUR/USD Market Movers EUR/USD technical analysis: Triangle in an uptrend EUR/USD has been posting higher lows and higher highs since the September 2022 lows, and this medium-term uptrend is likely to continue. Following a correction in February 2023, EUR/USD recouped its losses in March and made new year-to-date highs above 1.1000 on April 13. EUR/USD: Daily Chart Drilling down to the 4-hour chart (below) and price action looks to be tracing out a triangle price pattern which will eventually break out either higher or lower. Triangles are usually composed of five waves. This one now looks complete. If so, then a breakout is likely close at hand. EUR/USD: 4-hr Chart The Chaikin Money Flow oscillator, is an indicator that is supposed to help give clues as to the eventual direction of a breakout from a range bound market, and it has kept below the zero-line during most of the evolution of the triangle, suggesting a slight bias towards expecting a downside break. That said, the triangle has a flatter top suggesting it might be of the right-angled variety with a slight bullish bias. Either way, if price pierces below the 1.0917 lows it will probably confirm a downside breakout, with a target at around 1.0850. Alternatively, a breach of 1.0990 high would confirm an upside breakout, which would likely retouch the 1.1075 year-to-date highs. Taking a bigger-picture perspective, a break and daily close above the 1.1075 year-to-date highs of April 14 would indicate the overarching uptrend was kicking off again and suggest a move up to the next key resistance level at around 1.1190, where the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) is situated. For bears, a break and close below the important lower high at 1.0830 would bring into doubt the validity of the uptrend and could see losses extend down to a confluence of support at 1.0775-1.0800, and a possible reversal of the dominant trend. Euro FAQs What is the Euro? The Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, itaccountedfor 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day.EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world,accountingfor an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%). What is the ECB and how does it impact the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy.The ECB’s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates – or the expectation of higher rates – will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa.The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. How does inflation data impact the value of the Euro? Eurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB’s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control.Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money. How does economic data influence the value of the Euro? Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency.A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall.Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone’s economy. How does the Trade Balance impact the Euro? Another significant data release for the Euro is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period.If a country produces highly sought after exports then its currency will gain in value purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance. ",0

Spot prices, however, keep the red through the early North American session and currently trade around the 1.2415-1.2420 area, still down nearly 0.20% for the day. The British Pound weakens across the board following the disappointing UK macro releases, which, along with an intradayUS Dollar(USD) uptick, exert some downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair.

Adding to this, the flash UK ManufacturingPMIdelivers a negative surprise and drops further into contraction territory, to 46.6 in April, offsetting the better-than-expected Services PMI, which rose to 54.9 in April. The USD, on the other hand, initially drew support from growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will continue raising interestrates. This was seen as another factor weighing on the GBP/USD pair, though the intraday downfall stalls ahead of the 1.2350 strong horizontal support. The ongoing downfall in the US Treasury bond yields, along with a modest recovery in the global risk sentiment, act as a headwind for the safe-haven Greenback.

TheUS Dollar(USD) jumps back closer to the weekly high following the release of the USPMIprints, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the USD/JPY pair higher. In fact, S&P Global reported this Friday that business activity in the US private sector expanded at a strengthening pace in April, with the Composite PMI rising to 53.5 from 52.3 in March. Adding to this, the gauge for the manufacturing moves in the expansion territory and comes in at 50.4, while Services PMI edges higher to 53.7, also surpassing consensus estimates. The data reaffirmed expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will continue raising interestrates, which leads to a goodish intraday recovery in the US Treasury bond yields and benefits the Greenback. The Japanese Yen (JPY), however, might continue to draw support from expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could begin to phase out its massive stimulus programme later this year. The bets were lifted by the domestic consumer inflation figures released earlier this Friday, which might contribute to capping the upside for the USD/JPY pair, Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before traders start positioning for the resumption of the recent move-up from the vicinity of mid-130.00s, or the monthly low.

The EUR/USD is moving with a bullish bias according to analysts at MUFG Bank. They see the pair trading in the range 1.0700 -1.1400 over the next weeks. Key quotes: “The EUR has continued to outperform other G10 currencies. The EUR is benefitting from the easing of last year’s negative terms of trade shock. The incomingeconomic dataflow from the euro-zone is continuing to surprise to the upside although not as strongly as at the start of this year.” “Fears over a sharper growth slowdown have also been eased by the quick action taken by the Swiss authorities to deal with concerns over the health of Credit Suisse that have helped reduce financial stability risks in Europe.” “The better than expected growthoutlookfor the euro-zone economy is putting pressure on the ECB to raise rates further. We still expect the ECB to step down the pace of hikes at their next policy meeting on 4th May by delivering a 25bps hike but one can’t rule out another larger 50bps hike.” “We expectEUR/USDto move up into a higher trading range after breaking above the 1.1000-level on a more sustained basis.”,1
"The EUR/USD prepares to finish the week on a higher note, though it remains below the 1.1000 figure, albeiteconomic datafrom the United States (US) bolstered theUS Dollar(USD). However, late into the Wall Street close, the greenback lost strength, US equities rose, and the Euro  (EUR) recovered some ground. Hence, the EUR/USD is trading at 1.0988 after reaching a low of 1.0937. US business activity picked up, but not so in the EU Sentiment across the New York (NY) session fluctuated between risk-on/off. Investors’ recessionary fears about the US were pushed away by April’s S&P Global PMI figures, which showed the economy’s resilience, despite the US Federal Reserve (Fed) 475 bps of tightening. Manufacturing and Services PMIs exceeded estimates, with the former at 50.4, above 49 expectations, while the latter jumped to 53.7 from 51.5 estimates. Therefore, the Composite Index aimed higher to 53.5. The market initially reacted to buying the US Dollar, which gained some ground vs. the Euro, as it dived to 1.0942. Nevertheless, buyers moved in and liftedthe EUR/USD pair, though they failed to crack the 1.1000 mark. This happened after Thursday’s data, namely, US unemployment claims, housing data, and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, flashed a gloomy scenario, triggering flows towards safety, except for the US Dollar. Aside from this, on theEurozone(EU) side, Thursday’s calendar featured a surplus in the Balance of Trader of €4.6B, better than January’s deficit of €-31.6B, which was upward revised, alongside the Consumer Confidence, which improved a tick, to -17.5 above -18.5 estimates. On Friday, the EU’s PMI was mixed, with the Manufacturing Index at 45.5, standing at contractionary territory missing estimates, while the Services and Composite Indices exceeded the consensus, expanding. Fed and ECB May decisions loom Meanwhile, central bankers from both sides of the Atlantic continued their hawkish rhetoric. For one part, Federal Reserve (Fed) officials agreed that inflation is too high, though there’s a myriad of opinions regarding how much tightening is left. Onthe European Central Bank (ECB), the baseline was made by its ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane, with most policymakers yet undecided about liftingratesby 50 or 25 bps. EUR/USD Technical Analysis  From a daily chart perspective, the EUR/USD remains supported by the 20-day EMA from March 20 until today. Yet EUR/USD tested the April 21, 2022 high-turned-support at 1.0936, bounced off, and clung to the 1.0980s area amidst the lack of an impactful catalyst that could break the EUR/USD’s trading range. Should the EUR/USD reclaim 1.1000, a test to the YTD high is on the cards, followed by 1.1100. Conversely, a fall below 1.0900 will expose the 20-day EMA at 1.0911. If EUR/USD drops below the latter, a dive to 1.0800 is likely. EUR/USD  ",1

He added there were still signs of stubbornly high inflation. However, the United Kingdom Retail Sales data landed on Friday contracted more than expected.

Further stretch in recovery above April 13 high at 1.2537 will drive the asset towards a fresh 10-month high at 1.2597, which is 08 June 2022 high. A breach of the latter will expose the asset to May 27 high at 1.2667. On the flip side, a slippage below April 10 low at 1.2345 will expose the asset to March 30 low at 1.2294 followed by March 27 low at 1.2219. GBP/USD daily chart  GBP/USD  ",0

For March, Durable Goods Orders data is seen expanding by 0.8% vs. a contraction of 1.0%. An upbeateconomic datawould be supportive of more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve (Fed).

Also, the preliminary Services PMI jumped to 53.7 from the estimates of 51.5 and the former release of 52.6. Upbeat performance from Manufacturing and Services PMI indicates that economic recovery in the US economy is well on track and labor demand could rebound dramatically.

"The AUD/USD drifts lower for the second successive day on Monday and drops to a one-and-half-week low, around the 0.6675 region during the Asian session. A combination of factors assists theUS Dollar(USD) to gain some positive traction on the first day of the new week, which, in turn, is seen exerting downward pressure on the AUD/USD pair. The recent hawkish signals by several Federal Reserve (Fed) officials reaffirmed market bets for another 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May. Adding to this, the incoming US macro data suggested that the world's largest economy remained resilient and supported prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed. The flash version of the S&P Global's PMI survey showed that the overall business activity in the US private sector expanded at a faster pace in April, with the Composite PMI rising from 52.3 in March to 53.5, or the highest since May last year. The upturn was led by the service sector, where activity grew for a third successive month and at the fastest rate for a year. Adding to this, the gauge for the US manufacturing sector moved in the expansion territory for the first time since October 2022, indicating growth momentum. The data reinforced expectations that the Fed will continue lifting interestratesto curb inflation and fuels worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs. This, in turn, tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets, which is evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets. The anti-risk flow is seen as another factor that benefits the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and weighs on the risk-sensitiveAussie, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the AUD/USD pair is to the downside. That said, the recent pullback in the US Treasury bond yields might hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. Apart from this, the hawkish tone from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) April meeting minutes and the upbeat China macro data released last week should help limit losses for the AUD/USD pair. There isn't any relevant market-movingeconomic datadue for release from the US on Monday. Hence, traders will take cues from the broader risk sentiment to grab short-term opportunities around the pair. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0

The major support at 0.6620 is unlikely to come under threat. On the upside, a break of 0.6730 (minor resistance is at 0.6710) would indicate that the build-up in downward momentum has faded.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our most recent narrative was from last Monday (17 Apr, spot at 0.6710).

Our view was turned out to be correct as USD dropped to 133.54 and then rebounded strongly to closed largely unchanged (134.15, -0.06%). USD appears to have moved into a consolidation phase and it is likely to trade between 133.60 and 134.60.” Next 1-3 weeks: “We have expected USD to trade with an upward bias since early last week. In our latest narrative from last Thursday (20 Apr, spot at 134.65), we indicated that the bias is still towards a higher USD and the next level to aim for is 135.75. USD has not been able to make further headway on the upside. Upward momentum is beginning to fade and the likelihood of USD advancing to 135.75 is diminishing. However, only a break of 133.50 (no change in ‘strong support’ level) would indicate that USD is likely to trade in a range instead of heading higher to 135.75.”",1

The Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, itaccountedfor 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day.EUR/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world,accountingfor an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR/JPY (4%), EUR/GBP (3%) and EUR/AUD (2%). What is the ECB and how does it impact the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy.The ECB’s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates – or the expectation of higher rates – will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa.The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. How does inflation data impact the value of the Euro? Eurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB’s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control.Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money. How does economic data influence the value of the Euro? Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency.A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall.Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone’s economy. How does the Trade Balance impact the Euro? Another significant data release for the Euro is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period.If a country produces highly sought after exports then its currency will gain in value purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance. ",1
"The GBP/USD pair struggles to capitalize on Friday's goodish rebound of over 65 pips from the 1.2365 area and kicks off the new week on a subdued note. Spot prices seesaw between tepid gains/minor losses through the early European session and currently trade around the 1.2435 region, nearly unchanged for the day. A combination of factors assists theUS Dollar(USD) to gain some positive traction on the first day of the new week, which, in turn, is seen acting as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. The recent hawkish signals by several Federal Reserve (Fed) officials reaffirmed market bets for another 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May. Moreover, the incoming US macro data suggests that the world's largest economy remained resilient and supports prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed. Apart from this, a generally weaker risk tone benefits the Greenback's relative safe-haven status. The market sentiment remains fragile amid worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs. This is evident from a fresh leg down in the equity markets and drives some haven flows towards the buck. The downside for the GBP/USD pair, however, remains cushioned, at least for the time being, amid rising bets for an additional interest rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) in May. In fact, the markets now see over a 90% chance of a 25-bps rate hike in May. The bets were lifted by last week's release of stronger UK wage growth data and the stubbornly high inflation figures. In the absence of any relevant market-moving economic releases, either from the UK or the US, the aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before placing aggressive directional bets around theGBP/USDpair. Traders also seem reluctant ahead of this week's key macro data from the US, including the Advance Q1 GDP print on Thursday and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - the Core PCE Price Index - on Friday.

That said, a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields holds back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and caps the USD/JPY pair amid a weaker risk tone. Worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs temper investors' appetite for riskier assets, which is evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets. This, in turn, could drive some haven flows towards the JPY and keep a lid on any meaningful upside for the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. In the absence of any relevant market-moving economic releases, the aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop warrants some caution before positioning for any further intraday appreciating move for the major.

"The EURUSD pair exhibits an upward trajectory as it trades close to its daily high. Analyzing the hourly chart, the day's price action began with the pair dipping to the 100-hour moving average (depicted by the blue line in the chart above). However, buyers found support at this level and pushed the price higher. The significance of this moving average level has increased as the week commences. As buyers find support, the price rose to a high of 1.10199 during Monday's morning session. In the past four hours or so, the price has been fluctuating. On the downside, the pair has discovered support near the low of a swing area between 1.0999 and 1.10066, with the low reaching 1.09984, just below the swing area's low. Buyers are once again entering the market to defend this support level. At the moment, buyers are attempting to gain control. If they manage to maintain the price above the 1.0998 level, the market could potentially explore further upside. On the other hand, if the price falls below this level, it may disappoint investors and prompt additional downside probing. In such a scenario, the rising 200-hour moving average at 1.0979 would be the next target, followed again by the 100-hour moving average at 1.09682.",1
"The GBP/USD pair attracts some dip-buying in the vicinity of the 1.2400 mark on Monday and touches a fresh daily high during the early North American session. The pair is currently placed around the 1.2450 region, up nearly 0.20% for the day, though the intraday uptick lacks bullish conviction. TheUS Dollar(USD) remains under some selling pressure for the third successive day and drops to a one-week low amid the ongoing downfall in the US Treasury bond yields. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor lending some support to the GBP/USD pair amid rising bets for an additional interest rate hike by theBank of England(BoE) in May. In fact, the markets now see over a 90% chance of a 25-bps rate hike in May. The bets were lifted by last week's release of stronger UK wage growth data and the stubbornly high inflation figures. The Federal Reserve (Fed) is also expected to continue raising interestratesto curb inflation. Moreover, the markets have fully priced in a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC policy meeting in May and the Fed funds future indicates another rate hike in June. The expectations were reaffirmed by the recent hawkish comments by several Fed officials and the incoming positive US macro data, which suggested that the world's largest economy remained resilient and supports prospects for further policy tightening by the US central bank. In the absence of any relevant market-moving economic releases on Monday, the aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop might hold back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around theGBP/USDpair. Traders also seem reluctant ahead of this week's important US macro data, starting with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index on Tuesday.

EUR/USD stronger on USD-selling EUR/USD clinches the third consecutive daily gain on the back of the continuation of the downward bias in the dollar and the generalized upbeat sentiment in the global markets. Furthermore, the underlying uptrend that prevails in spot since mid-March remains propped up by expectations of further tightening by the ECB at its upcoming meetings. On this, a 25 bps rate hike appears already largely priced in in May, while speculation of extra raises at the June and July gatherings also remains on the rise. In the data universe, Germany’s Business Climate tracked by the IFO institute came in below consensus despite improving marginally to 93.6 for the month of April. In the US, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index disappointed expectations after remaining unchanged at -0.19 in March. Later in the session, the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index will close the daily docket. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD picks up pace and manages to clear the key hurdle at the 1.1000 yardstick at the beginning of the week. Meanwhile, price action around the single currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the incipient Fed-ECB divergence when it comes to the banks’ intentions regarding the potential next moves in interestrates.

"TheUSD/JPY pairkicks off the new week on a positive note and builds on its steady intraday ascent through the early North American session. The momentum lifts spot prices to a fresh daily high, around the 134.70-134.75 region in the last hour and is sponsored by the heavily offered tone surrounding the Japanese Yen (JPY). The Bank of Japan (BoJ) Kazuo Ueda sounded dovish this Monday and said that the central bank must maintain monetary easing as trend inflation is still below 2%. Ueda added that inflation forecasts must be quite strong and close to 2% in the coming year to consider tweaking yield curve control. This marks a big divergence in comparison to the recent hawkish remarks by several Federal Reserve (Fed) officials, indicating that the US central bank will continue raising interestrates, and turns out to be a key factor pushing the USD/JPY pair higher. Meanwhile, the prospects for further policy tightening by the Fed fuel worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs and boosting demand for traditional safe-haven assets. This leads to a further decline in the US Treasury bond yields, which drags theUS Dollar(USD) to a one-week low and might hold back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the USD/JPY pair. Apart from this, the global flight to safety could benefit the JPY and further contribute to capping the upside for the major, at least for the time being. Traders might also prefer to wait on the sidelines ahead of this week's important US macro releases, starting with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index on Tuesday.

However, challenges to sentiment and cautious mood ahead of this week’s crucial US and Australia statistics prod theAussiepair buyers. That said, the pre-Fed blackout seems to help the markets in paring the previous weekly gains of theUS Dollar. US Dollar failed to cheer Friday’s upbeat activity data amid hopes of no more than a 0.25% rate hike and nearness to the policy pivot. Also weighing on the greenback could be the drama surrounding the US debt ceiling, which is scheduled for expiration in June. Additionally weighing the greenback could be the comparatively less hawkish Fed speak, as well as upbeat Wall Street. That said, S&P 500 Futures remained mostly flat on Tuesday. On the other hand, the Financial Times (FT) came out with the news suggesting that allies resist the US plan to ban all G7 exports to Russia, which in turn supports a mild risk-on mood. On the other hand,Eurozoneplans to ban exports from Russia. Amid these plays, Wall Street benchmarks closed mixed while the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields remain mostly downbeat, around 3.50% and 4.12% respectively.

"GBP/USDmarches to the highest levels in seven days as bulls attack the 1.2500 threshold during Tuesday’s Asian session. In doing so, the Cable pair justifies the late Monday’s upside break of a one-week-old previous resistance line, as well as the bullish MACD signals, while staying within a three-week-long ascending trend channel. With this, GBP/USD appears all set to extend the latest run-up towards the previous support line from March 15, around 1.2540. However, the aforementioned channel’s top line, close to 1.2560 by the press time, could challenge the pair buyers afterward. It’s worth noting, however, that the RSI (14) is approaching the overbought territory and hence the GBP/USD pair’s upside past 1.2560 appears difficult. In a case where the quote rises past 1.2560, the 1.2600 round figure and the May 2022 peak of around 1.2665 will be in the spotlight. On the flip side, a convergence of the one-week-old previous resistance line and an upward-sloping trend line from Friday, close to 1.2440, puts a floor under the GBP/USD prices. Following that, the stated channel’s bottom line and the 200-SMA, respectively near 1.2370 and 1.2325, could challenge the Cable bears before giving them control.

Preliminary United States S&P Manufacturing PMI showed a recovery after landing above 50.0 for the first time in the past six months. It is worth noting that a figure of 50.0 is considered an expansion in the scale of PMI. However, a one-time figure of recovery is insufficient to infuse optimism in investors.

However, concerns surrounding a policy pivot and rate cuts in 2023 seem to keep traders on their toes. Additionally, the geopolitical fears surrounding Russia and China join the market’s cautious mood ahead of this week’s top-tier growth and inflation data to prod the sentiment.

"UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang note the upward momentum is building inEUR/USD, with the next target at 1.1120. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We noted yesterday that ‘the underlying tone has firmed somewhat’ and we expected EUR to edge higher. However, we were of the view that ‘a clear break above 1.1025 appears unlikely’. The anticipated EUR strength exceeded our expectations as EUR soared to a high of 1.1050. While the rapidly improving momentum suggests EUR is likely to advance further, it remains to be seen if it can maintain a foothold above the month-to-date high of 1.1075. The next major resistance at 1.1120 is unlikely to come into view today. The upward pressure is intact as long as EUR stays above 1.1010 (minor support is at 1.1025).” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (24 Apr, spot at 1.0990) we highlighted that ‘downward pressure has eased’. We added, ‘Theoutlookis neutral for the time being and EUR is likely to trade sideways in a range of 1.0900/1.1050’. We did not anticipate the swift and sharp rise to 1.1050. Upward momentum is building rapidly and EUR is likely to trade with an upward bias from here. However, it has to break and stay above the month-to-date high of 1.1075 before a move to the next major resistance at 1.1120 is likely. All in all, only a break of 1.0975 (‘strong support’ level) would indicate that the build-up in momentum has faded.”",1

While our view for GBP to advance was correct, it strengthened more than expected as it rose to a high of 1.2486. GBP extended its advance in early Asian trade but while it could rise above 1.2510, overbought conditions suggest that it might not be able to break clearly above the month-to-date high of 1.2545 today (next resistance is at 1.2600). Support is at 1.2465; a break below 1.2440 would indicate that the current upward pressure in GBP has eased.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our latest narrative was from last Friday (21 Apr, spot at 1.2435) wherein the recent downward pressure has faded and GBP is likely to trade sideways between 1.2345 and 1.2510. Yesterday, GBP rose to a high of 1.2486 and upward momentum is building rapidly. A break of 1.2510 will not be surprising and will increase the odds for further GBP strength in the coming days.

"The GBP/USD pair has dropped after failing to sustain above the psychological resistance of 1.2500 in the early European session. The Cable has sensed selling pressure asthe US Dollar Index(DXY) is aiming to extend its recovery above 101.33 also negative market sentiment is weighing on risk-sensitive assets. The USD Index rebounded sharply from 101.20 as investors are getting anxious ahead of the release of the United StatesGross Domestic Product(GDP) data, which will release on Thursday. Also, investors are anticipating that the sticky US core Consumer Price Index (CPI) could force the Federal Reserve (Fed) to remain hawkish on interest rate guidance. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures are consistently adding losses in the overnight session as the street is worried over quarterly results from giant technology stocks. The week is going to be pretty busy as three FAANG stocks will report their quarterly results. Meta Platforms (Facebook), Amazon, and Google. Also, Microsoft will come forward with quarterly earnings and revenue guidance. US data to provide more clarity on Federal Reserve policy Volatility in tradeable markets is expected to remain quite high ahead as investors are shifting their focus toward the interest rate policy from the Federal Reserve, which is due next week. Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce a consecutive 25 basis point (bp) interest rate hike and will pushratesabove 5%. However, the event that will grab major attention will be the interest rate guidance from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Considering the fact that the labor market conditions are getting softer, credit conditions from US commercial banks are getting tightened, and Producer Price Index (PPI) figures have significantly trimmed due to lower oil prices, the Federal Reserve will pause the rate hike regime after one more 25 bps rate hike. However, the release of the US Durable Goods Orders and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data will provide more clarity this week. March’s Durable Goods Orders data is seen expanding by 0.8% vs. a contraction of 1.0%. Later this week, Annualized (Q1) GDP is expected to contract to 2.0% vs. the former release of 2.6%. A decline in GDP numbers would fuel fears of a slowdown in the United States economy. This may also force the Federal Reserve to go for a steady stance on interest rate guidance. Bank of England to hike rates further to arrest double-digit Inflation The United Kingdom has been failing to arrest gigantic inflation in comparison with other developed economies. The inflation rate has remained stuck in the double-digit territory despite restrictive monetary policy from theBank of England(BoE) and tight fiscal policy from the UK government. Shortage of labor due to early retirement and the Brexit event, and 45-year high food inflation have been major constraints of galloping UK inflation. The street is anticipating one more 25 bps rate hike from BoE governor Andrew Bailey to continue pressure on stubborn inflation. GBP/USD technical outlook  GBP/USD has been consolidating in a wide range of 1.2347-1.2545 on a two-hour scale for the past three weeks. The pair is marching towards April 14 high at 1.2545 amid a solid upside momentum. April 19 high at 1.2472 is providing cushion tothe PoundSterling. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2460 is aiming higher, indicating more upside ahead. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is gauging cushion around 60.00.

"EUR/USD is on the cusp of printing the first intraday loss in four as it takes offers to reverse intraday gains around a one-week high, falling to 1.1050 amid early Tuesday morning in Europe. In doing so, the Euro pair takes a U-turn from a short-term key horizontal resistance amid the overbought RSI (14) line. With this, the EUR/USD sellers are well set to test a two-week-old horizontal support zone of around 1.1000. However, the 200-Hour Moving Average (HMA) and an upward-sloping trend line from April 10, forming part of a bearish triangle formation, respectively near 1.0985 and 1.0960, can challenge the EUR/USD bears afterward. In a case where the Euro pair drops below 1.0960, the odds of witnessing a south run towards the 61.8%Fibonacciretracement level of April 10-14 upside, near 1.0930, can act as the last defense of the EUR/USD buyers. On the contrary, a sustained break of the stated triangle’s top line, close to 1.1070, will defy the bearish chart pattern and can prod the latest multi-month high of around 1.1075. Though, the EUR/USD pair’s successful trading beyond 1.1075 won’t hesitate to challenge the late March 2022 high surrounding 1.1185.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We noted yesterday that USD ‘appears to have moved into a consolidation phase’, and we expected it to consolidate and trade between 133.60 and 134.60. USD then traded in a range of 133.88/133.74 before closing largely unchanged at 133.22 (+0.05%).

As highlighted, upward momentum is beginning to fade and the likelihood of USD advancing to 135.75 is diminishing.

In doing so, the risk barometer remains within a short-term rectangle formation comprising multiple levels marked since the last Friday amid a steady RSI (14) line, below the median line of late. However, a clear downside break of a fortnight-old ascending trend line and the 200-Hour Moving Average (HMA) joins the bearish MACD signals to keep Aussie bears hopeful. That said, the stated trend continuation pattern’s lower line, close to 0.6665 of late, puts a floor under the AUD/USD prices, a break of which could quickly direct the sellers towards the monthly low of 0.6620. In a case where the AUD/USD price remains bearish past 0.6620, the 0.6600 round figure and the yearly low marked in March around 0.6560 could lure the sellers. On the flip side, the aforementioned rectangle’s top line, around 0.6710 at the latest, precedes the 200-HMA level of 0.6720 to restrict the short-term recovery of the AUD/USD pair. Following that, the previous support line stretched from April 11, near 0.6725 can act as the last defense of the AUD/USD bears. Should the AUD/USD buyers keep the reins past 0.6725, a one-week-old horizontal resistance area between 0.6770 and 0.6780 can challenge the upside momentum.

"Fresh selling pressure now dragsEUR/USDto the low-1.1000s on the back of some tepid recovery in the dollar on Tuesday. EUR/USD continues to target the 2023 high EUR/USD now succumbs to the better mood around the dollar and snaps three consecutive sessions with gains on Tuesday. Despite the knee-jerk, the pair remains poised for the continuation of the uptrend in the short-term horizon. Indeed, this view remains underpinned by firmer speculation that the ECB will raise the policy rate in June and July, which in turn appears propped up by the unabated hawkish narrative from ECB’s rate setters. The absence of data releases in the euro docket on Tuesday will surely leave the attention to the US calendar, where the Consumer Confidence tracked by the Conference Board will be in the centre of the debate seconded by New Home Sales, and the FHFA’s HousePrice Index. What to look for around EUR Renewed weakness now prompts EUR/USD to retreat from recent peaks in response to some signs of life from the greenback. Meanwhile, price action around the single currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the incipient Fed-ECB divergence when it comes to the banks’ intentions regarding the potential next moves in interestrates. Moving forward, hawkish ECB-speak continue to favour further rate hikes, although this view appears in contrast to some loss of momentum in economicfundamentalsin the region.

"GBP/USD reverses its earlier course after hitting a weekly high of 1.2507 and drops towards the 1.2400 figure amidst a risk-off impulse that triggered flows towards safe-haven assets.

US Consumer Confidence Drops, Fed’s Manufacturing and Services Indices Decelerate, BoE Chief Economist Urges Higher Rates Sentiment remains deteriorating as the latest tranche of economic data from the United States (US) increased investors’ worries. Consumer Confidence in the United States dipped to its lowest level since July at 101.3, vs. estimates of 104.0. “Consumers became more pessimistic about the outlook for both business conditions and labor markets,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economics at the Conference Board. Further data, like the Philadelphia Fed Non-Manufacturing Activity plunging to -22.8, sparked recessionary fears. Of late, the Dallas Fed revealed the Services Activity Index for April, showing a slight improvement, to -14.4 vs. -18.8 in March, after yesterday’s report showed that the Manufacturing Index plunged to -23.4, as business conditions worsened. Other data revealed that New Home Sales for March rose by 9.6%, exceeding 1.1% estimates, as increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve will pause its tightening cycle has kept mortgageratesstable. Given the backdrop, the GBP/USD extended its losses due to risk aversion, even though US Treasury bond yields are plunging. Conversely, the greenback is rising 0.48%, as shown by the USDollar Indexat 101.815. Across the pond, the UK agenda revealed the CBI Industrial Trend Order, which stood at -20, neither improving nor worsening, though flashed that the economy is stagnating.

Of late, theBoEChief Economist Huw Pill commented that British people need to accept that they are “poorer.” Pill added that recent events call for higher rates and foresees UK’s inflation would dip to 2% in two years. GBP/USD Technical Analysis  From a technical perspective, the GBP/USD appears to have formed a head-and-shoulders chart pattern that could drive prices to test the confluence of the 100 and 200-day EMAs at around 1.2170. But firstly, the GBP/USD must break below the head-and-shoulders neckline at approximately 1.2360/70, so it could confirm its validity. If that scenario plays out, the GBP/USD next support would be the 50-day EMA at 1.2289 and then the 1.2200 figure.

Such behavior reflects more demand for safety. In Wall Street, stocks are falling with the Dow Jones down 0.39% and the Nasdaq 1%, amid mixed US data and renewed banking concerns. US data released on Tuesday showed an increase in the S&P/Case-Shiller HomePrice Indexin February of 0.4% from a year ago; a 9.6% surge in New Home Sales in March and a decline to six-month lows in CB Consumer Confidence in April. On Wednesday, Australia will report inflation data. The consensus is for the Consumer Price Index to have risen 1.3% in the first quarter; and for the annual rate to decline from 6.8% in February to 6.6% in March.

Next week, the Fed will announce May’smonetary policyin which an interest rate hike by 25 basis points (bps) is widely anticipated and the street was earlier expecting that the Fed will pause its quantitative tightening regime after this interest rate hike. Meanwhile, fresh recovery in United States economic activities as Manufacturing PMI has landed in expansion territory, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) is still persistent, and a recovery in the housing market indicate that Fed chairJerome Powellcould remain hawkish while guiding about forward interestrates. S&P500 settled Tuesday’s session on a bearish note despite upbeat earnings from Microsoft and Google.

"EUR/USDbears take a breather after witnessing the biggest daily loss in 1.5 months, making rounds to 1.0980-70 during the early hours of Wednesday’s Asian session. In doing so, the Euro pair seeks fresh clues after the banking fears roiled themarket sentimentand fuelled the US Dollar’s demand. With this, the major currency pair even ignored hawkish comments fromthe European Central Bank (ECB)Officials, as well as mixed US data. It’s worth noting that an update surrounding the major central bank’s Dollar operations also underpinned the US Dollar’s rebound and exerted downside pressure on the quote. The First Republic Bank’s (FRB) disappointing earnings reports joined the executives’ resistance in taking questions and no earnings guidance to trigger the fresh wave of banking jitters and weighed on the market sentiment the previous day. Adding strength to the risk aversion were calls that the central bankers are well set for higher rates even as the economics aren’t suitable. Furthermore, the geopolitical concerns surrounding Russia and China also spoil the risk appetite and provide a tailwind to the US Dollar. In doing so, the EUR/USD ignores hawkish comments from the ECB policymakers. That said, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane mentioned that the current data suggest we have to raise interestratesagain at the upcoming meeting. The policymaker also added, “Beyond May 4 meeting, further rate hikes will depend on data.” Further, ECB Governing Council member and Bank of France head Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that they are likely at the inflation peak today while also adding, “Inflation will probably come down towards 2% at the end of 2024.” Apart from the ECB talks, the mixed US data also failed to prod the EUR/USD bears. On Tuesday, US Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index edged lower to 101.3 for April, versus 104.0 prior and  Additional details of the publication stated that the Present Situation Index ticked up to 151.1 during the said month from 148.9 prior whereas the Consumer Expectations Index dropped to 68.1 from 74 previous readings. Further, the one-year consumer inflation expectations eased to 6.2% in April from 6.3% in March. In a different release, the US New Home Sales rose to 0.683M MoM in March versus 0.634 expected and 0.623M revised prior while the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices and Housing Price Index both rose past marketforecastto 0.4% and 0.5% respectively for February. Amid these plays, Wall Street closed in the red and the US Treasury bond yields were down too, which in turn allowed the USDollar Index(DXY) to snap a three-day downtrend. Moving on, US Durable Goods Orders for March will be important to watch as it offers clues for Thursday’s USGross Domestic Product(GDP) for the first quarter (Q1). Technical analysis Despite the latest retreat, EUR/USD bears need validation from a three-week-old ascending support line, around 1.0965 to convince sellers.

Investors are pumping money into the USD Index amid anxiety ahead of the monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed), which is due next week. S&P500 futures have added significant gains in the Asian session. The 500-US stocks basket witnessed an intense sell-off on Tuesday after vulnerable quarterly earnings from the First Republic Bank renewed fears of a banking fiasco. The United States commercial bank reported a steep decline in deposits from customers, which forced it to rely on external borrowings that come with heavy interest tags. Significant gains added in S&P500 futures in early Asia indicate a recovery in the risk appetite of the market participants. The US Treasury yields have also rebounded as a recovery in the S&P500 futures has impacted demand for US government bonds. The 10-year US Treasury yields have scaled to near 3.42%. The USD Index has turned sideways after a corrective move to near 101.80. This week, USGross Domestic Product(GDP) data will remain in the spotlight. Annualized GDP (Q1) is expected to decelerate to 2.0% from the former release of 2.6%. This would indicate a slowdown in the US economy must be due to higher interestratesfrom the Fed. On theEurozonefront, European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council member and Bank of France head Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Tuesday, “Inflation will probably come down towards 2% at the end of 2024.” He further added, “Food price inflation will start to ease in 2h 2023.” EUR/USD  ",1
"Bank of Japan´s governor Kazuo Ueda is speaking in Parliament and the following comments are coming across the wires: Key comments Monetary easing is not aimed at funding government spending.Consideration towards govt's debt-financing cost won't constrain necessary monetary policy moves.Dealing with cost-push inflation with monetary policy is very difficult, it's about striking balance between need to curb inflation and supporting economy.Cost-push inflation driven by rising raw material costs seems to be subsiding in Japan.Risk of rise in inflation driven by lost of market trust in Japan's finances low for now. In general, dealing with cost-push inflation is very difficult for central banks. On the one hand, you'd like to curb inflation. On the other hand, you don't want to tighten monetary policy knowing that cost-push inflation will cool the economy."" Ueda told parliament. ""Striking the right balance is very difficult. It depends on economic developments at the time, including where inflation stood at the outset.""  ",0

About Australia´s Consumer Price Index The quarterly Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has a significant impact on the market and the AUD valuation. The gauge is closely watched by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), in order to achieve its inflation mandate, which has majormonetary policyimplications.

"AUD/USD marks a swift move of around 20 pips while refreshing the six-week low on mostly downbeat Australian inflation data during early Wednesday. That said, theAussiepair initially dropped to 0.6611 before recently poking 0.6630 as traders turn cautious ahead of the key US Durable Goods Orders for March. Australia’s Monthly CPI drops to 6.1% YoY in March versus 6.6% expected and 6.8% prior, confirming policymakers’ latest claims of easing inflation pressure due to higherrates. On the same line, the Q1 CPI also eased to 1.4% QoQ from 1.9% in previous readings but crossed the 1.3% market forecasts. Further, theRBATrimmed Mean CPI declines below 1.4% consensus and 1.7% prior to 1.2% QoQ in the first quarter (Q1). Also read:Breaking: Australia Q1 RBA trimmed mean CPI +1.2% QoQ misses expectations Apart from the mostly downbeat Aussie inflation data, the latest fears emanating from the First Republic Bank (FRB) and the US debt ceiling discussion also weigh on the AUD/USD prices. On Tuesday, the FRB’s disappointing earnings reports joined the executives’ resistance in taking questions and no earnings guidance to trigger a fresh wave of banking jitters. Even so, the major central banks tried to restore market confidence by curtailing the US Dollar operations initiated during the first wave of the banking crisis. “The world's top central banks are cutting the frequency of their dollar liquidity operations with the U.S. Federal Reserve from May, sending the clearest signal yet that last month's financial market volatility is essentially over,” said Reuters. Furthermore, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that failure by Congress to raise the government's debt ceiling–and the resulting default–would trigger an ""economic catastrophe"" that would send interest rates higher for years to come, per Reuters. It should be noted that the mostly upbeat US data also keep the AUD/USD pair sellers hopeful, especially amid the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) dovish bias. On Tuesday, US Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index edged lower to 101.3 for April, versus 104.0 prior. Additional details of the publication stated that the Present Situation Index ticked up to 151.1 during the said month from 148.9 prior whereas the Consumer Expectations Index dropped to 68.1 from 74 previous readings. Further, the one-year consumer inflation expectations eased to 6.2% in April from 6.3% in March. In a different release, the US New Home Sales rose to 0.683M MoM in March versus 0.634 expected and 0.623M revised prior while the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices and HousingPrice Indexboth rose past marketforecastto 0.4% and 0.5% respectively for February. It should be observed, however, that the recent gains of the S&P 500 Futures and a pause in the US Treasury bond yields’ downside prod the AUD/USD bears. Having witnessed the initial reaction to Australia’s headline inflation numbers, the AUD/USD pair traders should closely observe the risk catalysts for clear directions ahead of the US Durable Goods Orders for March, expected to improve to 0.8% versus -1.0% prior. Technical analysis The AUD/USD pair’s sustained downside break of a 1.5-month-old support line, now immediate resistance near 0.6655, joins bearish MACD signals to keep the Aussie pair sellers hopeful.

"USD/JPY drops back towards the lowest levels in a week, mildly offered near 133.55 by the press time, as it defends the previous day’s downside break of the 50-DMA amid early Wednesday. Adding strength to the bearish bias is the steady RSI (14) line around the 50.00 level, as well as the looming bear cross on the MACD indicator. With this, the Yen pair is all set to revisit the eight-day low marked on Tuesday around 133.35. However, the 100-DMA support of near 132.90 could challenge the USD/JPY bears afterward. In a case where the quote remains bearish past 132.90, an upward-sloping support line from the mid-January, close to 131.90 by the press time, will be the last defense of the Yen pair buyers as a break of which could open doors for the pair’s fall towards the yearly low of near 127.20. Alternatively, a daily closing beyond the 50-DMA level of 133.80 becomes necessary for the USD/JPY buyers to take the risk of fresh entry. Even so, the latest swing high around 135.15 and a horizontal area comprising multiple levels marked since November 2022, surrounding 133.45-70, will be a tough nut to crack for the Yen pair bulls.

"EUR/USD treads water around 1.0980 heading into Wednesday’s European session as bears take a breather after posting the biggest daily loss in 1.5 months.

Also read:EUR/USD licks its wounds near 1.0970 after banking woes propelled the biggest daily fall in six weeks Apart from an immediate challenge to the EUR/USD pair’s momentum caused by the 50-SMA and the 100-SMA, an upward-sloping support line from late March, also restrict the quote’s nearby moves by offering a strong support around 1.0955. It’s worth noting, however, that the quote’s hesitance in accepting bids joins the bearish MACD signals and a mostly steady RSI (14) keeps the EUR/USD sellers hopeful. However, a clear downside break of the 1.0955 support confluence, encompassing the 100-SMA and the aforementioned trend line, becomes necessary to convince the Euro sellers. Even so, the 200-SMA level of 1.0865 can act as the last defense of the EUR/USD buyers. On the contrary, an upside break of the 50-SMA hurdle of 1.0980 will need validation from the 1.1000 psychological magnet to convince the Euro bulls.

"GBP/USDsteadiness around 1.2410-15 heading into Wednesday’s London open as bears take a breather after cheering the biggest daily slump in a week. In doing so, the Cable pair benefits from the market’s consolidation ahead of the US Durable Goods Orders for March. That said, the major central banks’ attempts to restore market confidence by curtailing the US Dollar operations initiated during the first wave of the banking crisis seemed to have put a floor under the GBP/USD prices of late. “The world's top central banks are cutting the frequency of their dollar liquidity operations with the U.S. Federal Reserve from May, sending the clearest signal yet that last month's financial market volatility is essentially over,” said Reuters. However, the looming banking crisis, triggered through the First Republic Bank (FRB) joins the fears of US default to check the Cable pair buyers. On Tuesday, the FRB renewed the woes of banking fallouts by flashing disappointing earnings reports and the executives’ resistance in taking questions, not to forget mentioning the absence of earnings guidance. On the other hand, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that failure by Congress to raise the government's debt ceiling–and the resulting default–would trigger an ""economic catastrophe"" that would send interestrateshigher for years to come, per Reuters. It’s worth noting that the ethics committee investigation on UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the cautious mood surrounding the Brexit deal with the European Union, as British PM Sunak pushes for easy travel rules, also challenge the GBP/USD pair’s recovery moves. Elsewhere, a jump in the UK’s borrowing in March that fuelled the British debt-to-GDP ratio reaching 100%, the highest since the 1960s, also weighs on the Cable pair prices. On the same line are the comments from Bank of England (BoE) officials as they hesitate confirming the hawkish bias. Firstly, BoE Deputy Governor, Ben Broadbent, said on Tuesday, “had we seen inflation shocks coming,BoEwould have tightened policy sooner.” Following him, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said that recent events moderated calls for higher interest rates. Furthermore, the US statistics have been mixed and contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) future moves, which in turn strengthen the market’s downbeat bias, despite the latest cautious optimism. That said, US Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index edged lower to 101.3 for April, versus 104.0 prior. Additional details of the publication stated that the Present Situation Index ticked up to 151.1 during the said month from 148.9 prior whereas the Consumer Expectations Index dropped to 68.1 from 74 previous readings. Further, the one-year consumer inflation expectations eased to 6.2% in April from 6.3% in March. Moving ahead, the US Durable Goods Orders for March, expected to improve to 0.8% versus -1.0% prior, will be important for the Cable pair traders to watch amid a light calendar in the UK. However, risk catalysts will be more important for a clear guide. Technical analysis Although a three-week-old ascending support line joins the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to restrict short-term GBP/USD downside around 1.2400-2395, recovery needs validation from the 10-day EMA hurdle of 1.2430 to convince Cable buyers.

"The AUD/USD pair is continuously declining towards the round-level support of 0.6600 after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported further softening of inflation data. The quarterly Consumer Price Index (CPI) (Q1) accelerated by 1.4% but was lower than the former pace of 1.9%. Annual inflation has softened to 7.0%, a little higher than the estimates of 6.9% but lower than the prior release of 7.8%. The monthly CPI indicator decelerated to 6.1% from the consensus of 6.6% and the previous release of 6.8%. A significant deceleration in Australian inflation is going to support the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to stay with the decision of keeping interestratesunchanged at 3.60%, as announced in April’smonetary policymeeting. Meanwhile, the USDollar Index(DXY) is eying an upside break of the consolidation formed in a narrow range above 101.80. S&P500 futures have added significant gains despite a bearish Tuesday, portraying a recovery in the risk appetite of the market participants. AUD/USD has delivered a breakdown of the Inverted Flag chart pattern formed on a daily scale. The aforementioned chart pattern is a trend continuation pattern in which a long consolidation is followed by a breakdown. Usually, the consolidation phase of the chart pattern serves as an inventory adjustment in which those participants initiate shorts, which prefer to enter an auction after the establishment of a bearish bias and current sellers add more positions. Going forward, the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around 0.6700 will act as a barricade for the Aussie bulls. Adding to that, a slippage into the bearish range of 20.00-40.00 by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) will trigger a downside momentum. US Dollar bulls will flex their muscles if theAussieasset will drop below March 15 low at 0.6590. An occurrence of the same will expose the asset to March 08 low at 0.6568 followed by 02 November 2022 high around 0.6500. In an alternate scenario, only a decisive move above the round-level resistance of 0.6800 will drive the asset toward February 23 high at 0.6872 and February 20 high at 0.6920.

Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We indicated yesterday that EUR ‘is likely to advance further but it remains to be seen if it can maintain a foothold above 1.1075’. EUR eked out a fresh year’s high of 1.1066 before plummeting to 1.0962. While the sharp and swift drop is oversold, there is room for EUR to decline further. However, the major support at 1.0900 is unlikely to come under threat (there is another support at 1.0940). Resistance is at 1.1000; a break of 1.1025 would indicate that the weakness in EUR has stabilized.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (25 Apr, spot at 1.1045), we highlighted that EUR ‘is likely to trade with an upward bias but it has to break and stay above the month-to-date high of 1.1075 before a move to the next major resistance at 1.1120 is likely’. We added, ‘a break of 1.0975 would indicate that the build-up in momentum has faded’. We did not anticipate the sharp drop in NY trade that took out our ‘strong support’ level of 1.0975 (low has been 1.0962). The build-up of upward momentum has fizzled out.

"The USD/JPY pair remains on the defensive for the second successive day on Wednesday, albeit manages to hold just above over a one-week low touched the previous day. The pair trades around the 133.50, down over 0.10% for the day during the early European session and is influenced by a combination of diverging forces. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) Kazuo Ueda's dovish remarks earlier this week, along with a modest recovery in the US equity futures, undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and act as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. It is worth recalling that the new BoJ Governor said on Monday that the central bank must maintain monetary easing as trend inflation is still below 2% and added that inflation forecasts must be quite strong and close to 2% in the coming year to consider tweaking yield curve control. The upside for the USD/JPY pair, however, remains capped, at least for the time being, amid renewed US Dollar (USD) selling, led by the recent slump in the US Treasury bond yields. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields registered its largest decline since March amid rising concerns about the regional banking sector, the possibility of an imminent recession and worries about the US debt ceiling. This, in turn, fails to assist the Greenback to capitalize on the overnight strong gains. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and move to wait on the sidelines ahead of the key US macro data/central bank event risk. Investors this week will confront the release of the Advance US Q1 GDP print on Thursday, which will be followed by the US Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. This, along with the crucialBoJmonetary policymeeting on Friday, should provide a fresh impetus and help determine the near-term trajectory for the USD/JPY pair. In the meantime, traders on Thursday will take cues from the release of the US Durable Goods Orders, due later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields, might influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the USD/JPY pair. Apart from this, the broader risk sentiment should further contribute to producing short-term opportunities around the major. Technical levels to watch USD/JPY  ",0
"GBP/USDrisks a deeper pullback once 1.2345 is cleared, according to Economist at UOB Group Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Yesterday, we indicated that GBP ‘could rise above 1.2510 but it might not be able to break clearly above the month-to-date high of 1.2545’. However, instead of rising above 1.2510, GBP plummeted from 1.2507 to a low of 1.2388. The sharp and rapid decline appears to be running ahead of itself but with no signs of stabilization just yet, GBP could drop further. In view of the oversold conditions, the major support at 1.2345 is unlikely to come under threat (there is another support at 1.2375). On the upside, a break of 1.2460 (minor resistance is at 1.2435) would indicate that the weakness in GBP has stabilized.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our view from yesterday (25 Apr, spot at 1.2485) wherein ‘a break of 1.2510 will not be surprising and will increase the odds for further GBP strength’ was invalidated quickly as GBP plunged and took out our ‘strong support’ level of 1.2415 (low of 1.2388). While the downward risk is beginning to build, GBP has to break and stay below 1.2345 before a sustained decline is likely.

"In the opinion of Economist at UOB Group Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang,AUD/USDis expected to face extra downside pressure in the short-term horizon. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “The outsized drop in AUD of 1.05% (NY close of 0.6626) came as a surprise (we were expecting AUD to trade in a range). While the rapid decline is clearly oversold, AUD could test 0.6600 before stabilization is likely. Today, the major support at 0.6565 is unlikely to come into view. The downside risk is intact as long as AUD stays below 0.6670 (minor resistance is at 0.6655).” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our most recent narrative was from last Monday (17 Apr, spot at 0.6710), wherein ‘there is no clear direction and AUD could trade in a relatively broad range of 0.6620/0.6785 for the time being’. AUD traded within the range for more than a week until yesterday when it dropped slightly below 0.6620 (low of 0.6614). Downward momentum is beginning to build and AUD is likely to edge lower in the coming days. However, any decline is likely to face solid support at the year-to-date low near 0.6565.

"The Euro (EUR) has made new 2023 highs against the US Dollar (USD) during the US session, on Wednesday, after an upbeat Wall Street open put paid to lingering recession fears, reducing safe-haven demand for USD. The pair has stabilized after the market turbulence witnessed on Tuesday in which the pair fell over 100 pips. From a technical perspective the overall trend is up, with the probabilities favoring longs over shorts. EUR/USD market movers EUR/USD technical analysis: Nearing year-to-date highs EUR/USDbreaks to new 2023 highs just shy of 1.1100 on Wednesday. Tuesday’s decline was violent but despite that the broader medium-term uptrend remains intact as long as the 1.0830 lows hold, and overall the odds favor a continuation of the dominant Euro-bullish trend. EUR/USD: Daily Chart It is still not clear whether the break above the 1.1075 previous year-to-date highs deserves to be described as 'decisive', however, if so, a continuation of the Euro’s uptrend would likely reach to the next key resistance level at around 1.1190, where the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) is located. A decisive break would be defined as one happening from a ‘breakout candle’ – a long green bullish daily candle that extends above the 1.1075 highs and closes near its high – or three smaller bullish green candles in a row (the three white soldiers Japanesecandlestickpattern). At the moment the break to new highs lacks momentum, suggesting caution should be exercised. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), for example, has not followed price to new highs when compared to the peak made on April 14 when price tipped 1.1075. This is a sign of bearish divergence. That said, the day is still not over and it is only after the close has fixed that a definitiveanalysiscan be made. Alternatively, from a bearish perspective, a break and daily close below the key lower high at 1.0830 could see losses extend down to a confluence of support at 1.0775-1.0800, marking a possible reversal of the dominant trend. European Central Bank FAQs What is the ECB and how does it influence the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region.The ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa.The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it affect the Euro? In extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets – usually government or corporate bonds – from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro.QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic. What is Quantitative tightening (QT) and how does it affect the Euro? Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro. ",1
"The GBP/USD pair regains positive traction on Wednesday and reverses a major part of the previous day's retracement slide from over a one-week high - levels just above the 1.2500 psychological mark. Spot prices build on the steady intraday ascent through the early part of the European session and currently trade around the 1.2455-1.2460 region, up over 0.40% for the day. The US Dollar (USD) struggles to capitalize on the overnight strong move up and comes under renewed selling pressure, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the GBP/USD pair. Fresh concerns about the regional banking sector crisis, the possibility of an imminent recession and worries about the US debt ceiling lift bets for an imminent rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) later this year. This, in turn, led to the overnight steep decline in longer-duration US Treasury bond yields and continues to weigh on the Greenback. Apart from this, a modest recovery in the US equity exerts additional downward pressure on the safe-haven buck and remains supportive of the GBP/USD pair's intraday positive move. The British Pound further seems to draw support from expectations for another 25 bps interest rate hike by the Bank of England (BoE) in May. The bets were lifted by last week's release of stronger UK wage growth data and consumer inflation figures, which, in turn, favours bulls and supports prospects for a further intraday appreciating move for the major. In the absence of any relevant market-moving macro data from the UK, traders now look to the US economic docket, featuring the release of Durable Goods Orders data later during the early North American session.

"The AUD/USD pair adds to the previous day's heavy losses and remains under some selling pressure for the second successive day on Wednesday. The pair maintains its offered tone through the first half of the European session and is currently placed around the 0.6600 mark, or its lowest level since mid-March. The Australian Dollar (AUD) weakens across the board after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the headline CPI eased from 1.9% to 1.4% during the March quarter, marking the smallest increase since late 2021. Furthermore, the annual CPI decelerated to 7.0% from 7.8% and suggests that inflation might have finally peaked. Adding to this, the softer core CPI eases pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia for another hike in interestratesand drags the AUD/USD pair lower. The US Dollar (USD), on the other hand, comes under some renewed selling pressure and erodes a major part of the overnight strong gains, which, in turn, is holding back bearish traders from placing aggressive bets around the AUD/USD pair. Fresh concerns about the regional banking sector crisis, the possibility of an imminent recession and worries about the US debt ceiling lift bets for an imminent rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) later this year, which, in turn, weigh on the Greenback. Apart from this, a modest bounce in the US equity futures exerts additional downward pressure on the safe-haven buck and contributes to limiting losses for the AUD/USD pair, at least for the time being. Nevertheless, the aforementioned fundamental still seems tilted in favour of bearish traders and supports prospects for additional losses. Hence, a subsequent fall back towards challenging the YTD low, around the 0.6570-0.6565 region, looks like a distinct possibility.

Excluding transportation, new orders increased 0.3% during the reported month as against consensus estimates pointing to a 0.2% fall and the 0.3% decline registered in March. The upbeat data, however, fails to impress the US Dollar (USD) bulls or provide any meaningful impetus to the GBP/USD pair. Meanwhile, a slight improvement in the global risk sentiment - as depicted by a modest uptick in the US equity futures - is seen weighing on the safe-haven Greenback amid speculations for an imminent rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) later this year. Apart from this, rising bets for another 25 bps interest rate hike by the Bank of England (BoE) in May continue to underpin the British Pound and remains supportive of the strong bid tone surrounding the GBP/USD pair. That said, a modest uptick in the US Treasury bond yields might hold back bearish traders from placing aggressive bets around the USD and keep a lid on any further gains for the major, at least for the time being. Investors also seem reluctant and could move to the sidelines ahead of the US Q1 GDP report on Thursday.

Fresh concerns about the regional banking sector crisis in the US, along with fears of an imminent recession and worries about the US debt ceiling, have been fueling speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interestrateslater this year. This, in turn, continues to drag the US Treasury bond yields lower and exerts heavy downward pressure on the Greenback. That said, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Kazuo Ueda's dovish remarks earlier this week, along with a modest recovery in the US equity futures, could undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and lend support to the USD/JPY pair. It is worth recalling that the new BoJ Governor said on Monday that the central bank must maintain monetary easing as trend inflation is still below 2% and added that inflation forecasts must be quite strong and close to 2% in the coming year to consider tweaking yield curve control. This, in turn, warrants caution for bearish traders. Hence, any subsequent downfall is more likely to find decent support near the 133.00-132.90 region, representing a technically significant 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) support. The market focus now shifts to the release of the US Q1 GDP report on Thursday and the US Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge on Friday. This, along with the highly-anticipatedBoJmonetary policymeeting, should provide some meaningful impetus and help investors to determine the near-term trajectory for the USD/JPY pair.

" The EUR/USD soars sharply above the past yearly high of 1.1076 and hits a 13-month high at around 1.1095. Concerns about the health of regional banks in the United States (US) triggered flows outside the US Dollar (USD), as shown by the USDollar Index(DXY), collapsing 0.75%. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD is trading at 1.1067. US Treasury bond yields, and the risks of a banking crisis in the US, the drivers of EUR/USD’s jump As the North American session began, the EUR/USD achieved a daily high shy of the 1.1100 figure, as First Republic Bank, which took over Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), witnessed its shares plunge 49% on Tuesday, as deposits shrank. That sparked fears of a possible contagion and a potential pause on the US Federal Reserve (Fed) tightening cycle. Therefore, the greenback fell. US Treasury bond yield dropping is one reason for the EUR/USD’s rise. Additionally, expectations for a US Federal Reserve 25 bps rate hike diminished to 75.3%, compared to 1 week 83.3%. EUR/USD Market Reaction  TheEUR/USDjumped from around the R1 daily pivot at 1.1040 and accelerated its uptrend towards the 1.1095 multi-month high, some pips of reaching the R1 daily pivot. Though it has retraced some 30 pips from the daily high, buyers are still in charge of the uptrend, and the 1.1100 figure is still in sight. EUR/USD Technical Levels EUR/USD  ",1
"GBP/USDrallied on Wednesday to a fresh high of 1.2515 on further signs of a US economic slowdown that has dented the US Dollar. Data this week has not been favorable for the Greenback and today´s orders for core capital goods slipping more than expected in March has weighed on the currency further. The USDollar index, DXY, which measures the currency against six major rivals, dropped to a low of 101.013 as new orders for key U.S.-manufactured capital goods fell more than expected last month. Shipments also fell suggesting that business spending on equipment was likely a drag on economic growth while investors await theGross Domestic Productnumbers.  All in all, driving the US Dollar versus other major currencies has been early signs of a US slowdown and decelerating inflation. Meanwhile and domestically, investors are pricing in rate hikes from the Bank of England that will push up Bank Rate to around 4.9% by September from 4.25% currently. Last week´s strong wage and Consumer Price Index data have shown that underlying inflation pressures are more persistent than previously expected. the CPI data in fact revealed Britain's inflation rate remained above the 10% mark for a seventh straight month in March. For that, analysts at TD Securities said that they expect a final 25bps hike in June, bringing the BoE's terminal rate to 4.75% (was 4.50%). ´´Strong inflation data continues to weigh on GBP rates. We believe the hawkish price action supports entering longs in GBP on a cross-market basis.´´ However, the more recent data have painted a mixed picture of the country's economy. Data from the ONS showed that Retail Sales fell more than expected in March amid the rising cost of living and poor weather conditions. The latest Markit PMI survey suggested that Britain's Gross Domestic Product grew the most in a year in April. GBP/USD technical analysis  The rally in GBP/USD has moved into the prior day´s shorts and has squeezed positions above yesterday´s highs. This could be a signal that the market is preparing to finally head lower as per the head and shoulders. However, a close above 1.2505 and then 1.2537, April 23 highs, will leave the bias in the hands of the bulls.",1

"The EUR/USD pairis consolidating in a narrow area around 1.1040 in the early Asian session. The major currency pair witnessed some profit booking after printing a fresh annual high of 1.0966 in the New York session. Investors turned cautious as the focus shifted to United StatesGross Domestic Product(GDP) (Q1) data. Market sentiment was extremely positive as investors were cheering bumper earnings data from US technology stocks such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms, however, the statement from the First Republic Bank that the government was reluctant to provide liquidity support after its collapse diluted the confidence of investors in the US administration. S&P500 futures ended Wednesday’s session on a weak note despite soaring chances of steady interest rate guidance from the Federal Reserve (Fed) for its May policy meeting after the release of downbeat US Durable Goods Orders data. The USDollar Index(DXY) showed a V-shape rally after dropping to near the crucial support of 101.00 as downbeatmarket sentimentimproved the appeal for the greenback as a safe-haven. Going forward, investors will keep their focus on the preliminary US GDP (Q1) data. As per the consensus, the US economy has grown by 2.0% in the first quarter of CY2023 on an annualized basis lower than the former growth rate of 2.6%. The lower pace of growth will cement fears of economic slowdown. On theEurozonefront, investors are divided about the pace of interest rate hike to be adopted bythe European Central Bank (ECB)in its monetary policy meeting next week. The street believes that options of 25 and 50 basis points (bps) are open as the shortage of labor is consistently propelling inflationary pressures. EUR/USD  ",0
"AUD/USD consolidates recent losses at the 1.5-month low as it flirts with the 0.6600 round figure during early Thursday morning in the Asia-Pacific zone. In doing so, theAussiesnaps a two-day downtrend but the bearish bias remains intact amid multiple negatives to the risk profile and surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) next move. On Wednesday, downbeat Aussie inflation numbers justify the RBA’s pause in the rate hike trajectory and suggested one such move in the next monetary policy meeting of the Australian central bank. However, the details weren’t too bad and hence may allow the RBA to show readiness for further rate hikes if needed. That said, Australia’s Monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped to 6.1% YoY in March versus 6.6% expected and 6.8% prior. On the same line, the Q1 CPI also eased to 1.4% QoQ from 1.9% in previous readings but crossed the 1.3% market forecasts. Further, the RBA Trimmed Mean CPI declined below 1.4% consensus and 1.7% prior to 1.2% QoQ in the first quarter (Q1). On the other hand, US Durable Goods Orders rose by 3.2% in March versus 0.8% expected and -1.2% prior. Further details suggest that the Durable Goods Orders ex Transportation and ex Defense also rose past market forecasts and previous readings in March. It’s worth noting that the cautious mood surrounding the US debt ceiling expiration exerts downside pressure on the AUD/USD price as most policymakers aren’t agreeing on the measures suggested by US President Joe Biden. It should be observed that the US House of Representatives currently votes on a bill suggesting the increase in the debt ceiling and to cut government spending, known as the ""Limit, Save, Grow Act"". Although the passage of the bill is only one step closer to the final destination, any disappointment can add to the risk-off mood and exert more downside pressure on the AUD/USD. Elsewhere, market sentiment sours amid escalating fears from the First Republic Bank (FRB) after the troubled bank’s shares dropped another 20% on Wednesday, following a 50% slump the previous day. With this, the FRB is likely to face the limits on its Fed borrowings, which in turn spreads therippleeffect across the markets and weighs on the risk appetite and the Aussie pair. Against this backdrop, the USDollar Index(DXY) dropped to the lowest levels in two weeks before paring some of the daily losses to end Wednesday’s trading near 101.43. Further, Wall Street closed mixed while the United States Treasury bond yields are mostly sidelined. Given the mostly downbeatmarket sentimentand dovish bias surrounding theRBA, the AUD/USD pair is likely to remain pressured ahead of the key US first quarter (Q1)Gross Domestic Product(GDP), expected to ease to 2.0% on an annualized basis versus 2.6% prior. On an immediate basis, Australia’s Q1 Export Price Index and Import Price Index can entertain the pair traders. Technical analysis Unless providing a sustained break of the seven-week-old previous support line, around 0.6655 by the press time, the AUD/USD pair remains vulnerable of refreshing the yearly low, currently around 0.6565.

"The GBP/USD pair has gradually corrected after failing to sustain above the psychological resistance of 1.2500 in the Asian session. The Cable has failed plenty of times in sustaining above the aforementioned resistance this month, making the Pound Sterling prone to further losses. On Wednesday, investors dumped risk-sensitive assets and ran for the USDollar Index(DXY) as a safe-haven after First Republic Bank cornered the US administration for not providing liquidity support. The USD Index showed a V-shape recovery after dropping to near the crucial support of 101.00. Meanwhile, the Pound Sterling sensed selling pressure amid a slowdown in accelerating Britishretail sales. A survey from Reuters showed that most shop chains do not foresee a lasting improvement in retail sales. Also, expectations for May were slightly negative. This might provide some relief to Bank of England (BoE) policymakers. GBP/USD is auctioning in a Rising Channel chart pattern on a two-hour scale in which every pullback is considered a buying opportunity. It is worth noting that the lack of upside momentum in thePound Sterlingis making it a fragile counter for the market participants. The Cable is still above 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.2468, indicating that the upside bias has not faded yet. Potential resistance is placed from April 14 high at 1.2545. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has slipped back into the 40.00-60.00 range, signaling a lack of momentum. A decisive move above April 13 high at 1.2537 will drive the asset towards a fresh 10-month high at 1.2597, which is 08 June 2022 high. A breach of the latter will expose the asset to May 27 high at 1.2667. On the flip side, a slippage below April 10 low at 1.2345 will expose the asset to March 30 low at 1.2294 followed by March 27 low at 1.2219. GBP/USD daily chart  GBP/USD  ",0
"EUR/USD stays defensive at the highest levels since March 2022, marked the previous day, as bulls run out of steam ahead of the key US first quarter (Q1)Gross Domestic Product(GDP) during early Thursday. That said, the Euro pair picks up bids to pare the late Wednesday’s retreat from the multi-day high to around 1.1045 by the press time. The Euro pair refreshed a 13-month high but failed to provide a daily closing beyond an upward-sloping resistance line from May 2022, around 1.1090 by the press time. Apart from the failure to cross the crucial resistance line, the bearish RSI divergence with the latest run-up in the EUR/USD price also teases the Euro pair sellers on an important data release day. TheEUR/USDpair’s tops marked since early February fail to gain support from the RSI (14) line as the higher high in prices commensurate the lower low of the oscillator, which in turn suggests a pullback in the quote before the next leg of the uptrend. However, a one-month-old ascending support line, close to 1.0970 by the press time, could challenge the intraday sellers of the pair. Following that, a convergence of the 100-DMA and an upward-sloping trend line from September 2022, close to 1.0765-55, will be in the spotlight as a break of which could reverse the pair’s upward trajectory from late 2022.

"USD/JPY picks up bids to consolidate recent losses around mid-133.00s as markets brace for the US Q1 GDP during early Thursday. Adding strength to the corrective bounce could be the cautious optimism surrounding the US debt ceiling extension and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Officials’ defense of the current ultra-easy monetary policy. Following the passages of the ""Limit, Save, Grow Act"", the White House spokesperson said that President Joe Biden has made clear this bill has no chance of becoming law. The same challenges the initial optimism surrounding the bill amid fears of long and difficult discussion on the key matter. Even so, Reuters said that the US House of Representatives on Wednesday narrowly passed a bill to raise the nation's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, defying President Joe Biden by attaching sweeping spending cuts for the next decade. It should be noted that former BoJ Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe recently mentioned that he will be surprised if the BoJ changes Yield Curve Control (YCC) on Friday. Previously, Bank of Japan´s (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda spoke in the Japanese Parliament, known as Diet, while saying that the risk of a rise in inflation driven by lost of market trust in Japan's finances low for now. The policymaker also tried to tame talks of inflation woes and indirectly suggests no change in this week’s monetary policy meeting, not even surrounding the YCC. Elsewhere, mixed US data and equity market performance also trouble the USD/JPY pair as the US Durable Goods Orders rose but the details of the Consumer Confidence eased. Furthermore, the tech giants allowed Nasdaq to remain firmer but the escalating fears from the First Republic Bank (FRB), due to another 20% share price fall on Wednesday following a 50% slump the previous day weigh on the sentiment. Against this backdrop, US Treasury bond yields remain directionless while the S&P 500 Futures print mild gains of 0.20% around 4,083 by the press time, following a mixed close of Wall Street. Looking forward, USD/JPY traders should pay attention to the risk catalysts, mainly surrounding the banks and US debt ceiling, while waiting for the US first quarter (Q1)Gross Domestic Product(GDP), expected to ease to 2.0% on an annualized basis versus 2.6% prior. Technical analysis A convergence of the previous support line from early April and a one-week-old resistance line, around 134.15, restricts the short-term recovery of the USD/JPY pair.

Today, EUR is more likely to trade in a range, likely between 1.1000 and 1.1100.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (26 Apr, spot at 1.0975), we highlighted that ‘instead of advancing, EUR is more likely to trade in a range for now, expected to be between 1.0900 and 1.1050’. However, EUR lifted off and soared above 1.1050 (high of 1.1095) before closing on a firm note at 1.1040 (+0.62%). Despite the relatively strong advance, upward momentum has not improved much. That said, EUR could ratchet higher upwards 1.1120. At this stage, the odds for a sustained rise above this level are not high. In order to keep the momentum going, EUR should not break below 1.0950 (‘strong support’ level).”",0
"USD/JPY treads water around 133.70 as it fades late Wednesday’s corrective bounce from a fortnight’s low during early Thursday in Europe. In doing so, the Yen pair fades rebound from the 100-SMA while justifying the early-week break of an upward-sloping trend line from April 05, now immediate resistance. Apart from the trend line break, downbeat MACD signals and steady RSI also keeps Yen pair sellers hopeful. However, a clear downside break of the 100-SMA level of 133.40 becomes necessary to convince sellers. Even so, the bottom line of the five-week-old ascending trend channel, close to 132.40 as we write, challenges the USD/JPY bears. In a case where the Yen pair remains bearish past 132.40, the odds of witnessing a gradual downturn towards the monthly bottom of 130.63 and then to the late March swing low of near 129.65 can’t be ruled out. Meanwhile, recovery moves need to cross the 134.45-50 resistance confluence to convince short-term buyers of the USD/JPY pair. A downward-sloping trend line from April 19 joins the three-week-long previous support line to highlight the stated hurdle. Should the pair buyers keep the reins past 134.50, the previously mentioned channel’s top line, close to 135.55 at the latest, can act as the last defense of the USD/JPY bears.

"GBP/USDcould advance on a more sustainable fashion once 1.2550 is cleared, suggest UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “Our view for GBP to drop further was incorrect as it rebounded strongly and retraced more than Tuesday’s entire drop (to a high of 1.2516). Despite the advance, there is no significant increase in momentum and instead of strengthening much further, GBP is more likely to trade sideways in 1.2420/1.2520 range.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (26 Apr, spot at 1.2415), we highlighted that ‘while the downward risk is beginning to build, GBP has to break and stay below 1.2345 before a sustained decline is likely’. We added, ‘the chance of GBP breaking clearly below 1.2345 will increase as long as it stays below 1.2490 in the next few days’. We did not expect the strong bounce that took out our ‘strong resistance’ level of 1.2490 (high of 1.2516). Despite the advance, upward momentum has not improved much. In order to advance in a sustained manner, GBP has to break and stay above 1.2550. The likelihood of GBP breaking clearly above 1.2550 will remain intact as long as it does move below 1.2370. Looking ahead, the next resistance level above 1.2550 is at 1.2665.”",1

EUR/USD now focuses on data, US GDP EUR/USD so far advances for the second session in a row and maintains the multi-week rally well and sound and with the immediate target now at the 1.1100 round level. It is worth noting that the pair closed with gains in 8 out of the last 9 weeks, having gained more than 5 cents since late February. In the meantime, hawkish ECB-speak and prospects for extra interest rate hikes following the May gathering continue to underpin the bullish stance in the European currency for the time being.

What to look for around EUR EUR/USD keeps the positive performance and continues to consolidate the recent breakout of the psychological 1.1000 barrier. Meanwhile, price action around the single currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the incipient Fed-ECB divergence when it comes to the banks’ intentions regarding the potential next moves in interestrates. Moving forward, hawkish ECB-speak continue to favour further rate hikes, although this view appears in contrast to some loss of momentum in economicfundamentalsin the region.

"The Euro (EUR) trades lower against the US Dollar (USD) after the release of several major US macroeconomic data releases during the early US session, on Thursday. The pair has stabilized above 1.1000, however, after a bout of recent volatility, caused by renewed recession fears and banking crisis deja vu in the US. From a technical standpoint, the overall trend is up and the probabilities favor long holders. EUR/USD market movers EUR/USD technical analysis: New triangle potentially forming EUR/USD reached a new 2023 high of 1.1095 and has rolled over to trade in the mid 1.10s, at the time of writing. The broader medium-term uptrend, however, remains intact – and will continue to – as long as the 1.0830 lows hold. Overall the odds favor a continuation of the dominant Euro bullish trend. EUR/USD: 4-hour Chart On the 4-hour chart,EUR/USDlooks like it may be forming a triangle pattern, with Wednesday’s highs representing a false breakout. If so, the triangle looks like it may have formed four distinct waves, labeled A-D on the chart above, and the current downmove could be wave E. Since triangles are usually composed of five waves it may be close to completing. Triangles can breakout in either direction but, given the dominant trend is bullish, the odds partially favor a breakout higher. As such, a decisive break above the 1.1095 year-to-date highs would confirm such a bullish breakout from the triangle, and a continuation of the Euro’s uptrend to the next key resistance level at around 1.1190, where the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) is located. If the triangle fulfills its full price potential, however, the Euro-US Dollar could even reach 1.1229. For the sake of clarity, a ‘decisive break’ might be a ‘breakout candle’ – a long green bullish daily candle that extends above the 1.1075 highs and closes near its high – or three smaller bullish green candles in a row that break above the highs. Alternatively, a break and daily close below the key 1.0909 lows would signify a bearish breakout from the triangle, with a target at 1.0805, which in itself could suggest a possible reversal of the dominant trend. European Central Bank FAQs What is the ECB and how does it influence the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region.The ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa.The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it affect the Euro? In extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets – usually government or corporate bonds – from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro.QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic. What is Quantitative tightening (QT) and how does it affect the Euro? Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro. ",0
"The AUD/USD pair once again shows resilience below the 0.6600 mark and attracts some buying on Thursday, snapping a two-day losing streak to its lowest level since mid-March touched the previous day. The pair maintains its bid tone through the early part of the European session, albeit lacks bullish conviction. The uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's rate-hike path fails to assist the US Dollar (USD) to capitalize on the overnight bounce from a nearly two-week low, which, in turn, is seen lending some support to the AUD/USD pair. Fresh concerns about banking contagion risks in the United States (US), along with the debt ceiling standoff and looming recession fears, have been fueling speculations about an imminent rate cut by the Fed later this year. Apart from this, a slight recovery in the global risk sentiment - as depicted by a stable performance around the equity markets - further undermines the safe-haven buck and benefits the risk-sensitiveAussie. The markets, meanwhile, seem convinced that the US central bank will hike interestratesby another 25 bps at the next FOMC policy meeting in May. This remains supportive of a further rise in the US Treasury bond yields, which acts as a tailwind for the Greenback and keeps a lid on any further gains for the AUD/USD pair. Traders also seem reluctant and preferred to wait on the sidelines ahead of the release of the Advance US Q1GDPreport, due later during the early North American session. The growth in the world's largest economy is anticipated to slow to a 2% annualized pace during the January-March period from the 2.6% rise in the previous quarter. Any significant divergence from the expected reading might infuse some volatility around the USD and provide a fresh impetus to the AUD/USD pair.

"TheGBP/USD pairstruggles to gain any meaningful traction on Thursday and oscillates in a narrow trading band through the first half of the European session. The pair is currently placed just above mid-1.2400s, nearly unchanged for the day, though the downside seems cushioned amid subdued US Dollar (USD) price action. The uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's rate-hike path, along with a slight recovery in the global risk sentiment, fail to assist the safe-haven buck to capitalize on the overnight bounce from a nearly two-week low and lend support to the GBP/USD pair.  Fresh concerns about banking contagion risks in the United States (US), along with the debt ceiling standoff and looming recession fears, have been fueling speculations about an imminent rate cut by the Fed later this year. The markets, however, have been pricing in a greater chance of another 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC policy meeting in May. This remains supportive of a further rise in the US Treasury bond yields, which acts as a tailwind for the Greenback and seems to cap the upside for the GBP/USD pair, at least for the time being. Moreover, the recent repeated failures to find acceptance above the 1.2500 psychological mark warrants some caution before positioning for any further gains. Traders also seem reluctant and wait on the sidelines ahead of the release of the Advance US Q1GDPreport, due later during the early North American session. The data, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, might influence the USD price dynamics and produce short-term trading opportunities around the GBP/USD pair. The market attention will then shift to the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - the US Core PCEPrice Indexon Friday. In the meantime, expectations for another 25 bps interest rate hike by the Bank of England (BoE) in May could underpin the British Pound and further contribute to liming the downside for the GBP/USD pair. The bets were lifted by last week's release of stronger UK wage growth data and consumer inflation figures, which, in turn, favours bullish traders and supports prospects for some meaningful near-term appreciating move for the major.

"The USD/JPY pair rebounds over 80 pips from the daily low touched during the early North American session and climbs to the 134.00 mark, a fresh daily high following the release of the USGDPreport. The US Bureau of EconomicAnalysisreported this Thursday that the economic growth decelerated from 2.6% annualized pace to 1.1% during the January-March period, missing estimates for a reading of 2.0%. That said, the price index component - the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure - rose more than expected, by 4.9% during the reported period and pointed to a further pickup in price pressures, reaffirming bets for another 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May. This remains supportive of a further rise in the US Treasury bond yields, which continues to act as a tailwind for the US Dollar (USD) and lends support to the USD/JPY pair. The sharp intraday spike could also be attributed to a goodish recovery in the global risk sentiment, which tends to undermine the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY). Furthermore, the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) dovish stance is seen weighing on the JPY and contributing to the move up. It, however, remains to be seen if the USD/JPY pair can capitalize on the move or if bulls opt to move to the sidelines ahead of the crucialBoJpolicy meeting on Friday.

This also marks the lowest level in three weeks. Nevertheless, the upbeat macro data reaffirms bets for another 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May and remains supportive of a further rise in the US Treasury bond yields, which underpins the US Dollar (USD) and exerts some pressure on the GBP/USD pair. The downside, however, remains cushioned, at least for the time being, amid growing acceptance that the Bank of England (BoE) will also hike interestratesby 25 bps in May.

"EUR/USD seesaws around 1.1030 after a whippy day that initially convinced bears before paring some of the losses during the American session. While the US data could be held responsible for Thursday’s volatility, the Euro pair’s latest inaction is logical ahead of the Eurozone Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the first quarter (Q1), as well as the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index details for March. On Thursday, the first readings of the USGross Domestic Product(GDP) for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023, also known as Advance readings, marked mixed outcomes. That said, the headline US GDP Annualized eased to 1.1% from 2.0% expected and 2.6% prior but the GDP Price Index inched higher to 4.0% on an annualized basis from 3.9% prior and 3.8% market consensus. Further, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Prices for Q1 rallied to 4.2% from 3.7% in previous readouts whereas the Core PCE figures also crossed 4.8% market forecasts and 4.4% prior with 4.9% mark for the said period. With this, a stronger-than-expected increase in the inflation component of the GDP renewed hawkish concerns about the Federal Reserve (Fed) and helped the US Dollar to pick up bids after the release. However, the downbeat prints of headline GDP allowed markets to turn optimistic and favoredthe EUR/USD pairbuyers. It’s worth noting that the banking fallout risks also prod the Euro bulls previously while the mixed EU data defended the buyers. That said, US banking fallout fears regain momentum amid reports that the First Republic Bank (FRB) plans to sell half its loan book to fill a $100B deposit flight gap.

"GBP/USDgradually marches towards the key upside hurdle as it grinds higher following a two-day winning streak, floating near 1.2500 during the initial hours of Friday’s Asian session. In doing so, the Cable pair defends the previous day’s rebound from the 100-bar Simple Moving Average (SMA) while also justifying the firmer Relative Strength Index (RSI), placed at 14, not overbought. With this, the quote’s further upside towards a horizontal area comprising multiple levels marked since April 04, around 1.2505-20, can’t be ruled out. However, the pair’s additional run-up will depend upon how well it can stay beyond the stated hurdle as the Year-To-Date (YTD) peak surrounding 1.2550 could challenge GBP/USD buyers afterward. In a case where the Cable pair remains firmer past 1.2550, a run-up towards the May 2022 peak of around 1.2665 becomes appealing. Meanwhile, pullback moves need to break the 100-SMA support of 1.2440 to convince intraday sellers. Following that, a fortnight-old ascending support line and the 200-SMA, respectively near 1.2410 and 1.2360, may prod the GBP/USD bears. It’s worth noting, however, that the GBP/USD pair’s weakness past 1.2360 will make it vulnerable to visiting the monthly low of around 1.2275.

With the upbeat inflation figures, the odds of witnessing a hawkish change in the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) future communication become brighter, which in turn weighs on the USD/JPY of late, even if the BoJ is expected to keep the current monetary policy unchanged. As a result, Friday’s BoJ becomes crucial for the USD/JPY pair traders as the aforementioned catalysts may allow the BoJ GovernorUedato have entertainment during the first day of the BoJ ruling. That said, Ueda’s speech and economic forecasts for the Asian major will be crucial to watch for clear directions. Also read:Bank of Japan Preview: New governor but old policy It’s worth noting, however, that the risk-on mood, mainly led by the strong US tech earnings and mixed US data, allowed Wall Street to have the biggest daily gain in a week. The same also propelled US Treasury bond yields and favored the USD/JPY to snap a two-day downtrend on Thursday. The first readings of the USGross Domestic Product(GDP) for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023, also known as Advance readings, marked mixed outcomes. That said, the headline US GDP Annualized eased to 1.1% from 2.0% expected and 2.6% prior but the GDP Price Index inched higher to 4.0% on an annualized basis from 3.9% prior and 3.8% market consensus. Further, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Prices for Q1 rallied to 4.2% from 3.7% in previous readouts whereas the Core PCE figures also crossed 4.8% market forecasts and 4.4% prior with 4.9% mark for the said period. It should be noted that a slump in the weekly Initial Jobless Claims also allowed the US Dollar to remain firmer. Having witnessed the initial market reaction to the Tokyo inflation numbers, USD/JPY pair traders are likely to wait for the BoJ decision even if the Japanese central bank isn’t expected to alter the current monetary policy and has already ruled out hawkish moves in the near future. The reason could be linked to Kazuo Ueda’s first meeting as a Governor and the presence of the economic forecasts for release. On Thursday, Former BoJ Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe mentioned that he will be surprised if the BoJ changes Yield Curve Control (YCC) on Friday.  Previously, Bank of Japan´s (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda spoke in the Japanese Parliament, known as Diet, while saying that the risk of a rise in inflation is driven by lost of market trust in Japan's finances low for now.  The policymaker also tried to tame talks of inflation woes and indirectly suggests no change in this week’s monetary policy meeting, not even surrounding the YCC. Following that, the US Core PCE Price Index for March, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, expected to ease to 4.5% YoY versus 4.6% prior, will be crucial to watch for the Yen pair traders, especially due to the next week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting.

"The EUR/USD pairhas stretched its recovery above 1.1030 in the Asian session. Earlier, the major currency pair sensed a significant buying interest from the psychological support of 1.1000 amid a correction in the USDollar Index(DXY). The USD Index has slipped further to near 101.00 as investors are worried that approval of the debt-ceiling increase proposal will impact the long-term rating of the United States economy. On the Eurozone front, Friday’s preliminary EurozoneGross Domestic Product(GDP) and German Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) carry significant importance as they will be the latest economicindicatorsbefore the interest rate decision bythe European Central Bank (ECB), which will be announced next week. EUR/USD is auctioning in an Ascending Triangle chart pattern on an hourly scale, which indicates a volatility contraction. Upward-sloping trendline of the aforementioned chart pattern is plotted from April 10 low at 1.0837 while the horizontal resistance is placed from April 14 high at 1.0760. The 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.1030 is overlapping the asset, indicating a sideways performance. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) is oscillating in the 40.00-60.00 range. The shared currency pair is expected to show a power-pack action after the release of theEurozoneeconomic data. The major currency pair will capture more gains only after decisively surpassing the round-level resistance of 1.1100. An occurrence of the same will drive the asset towards a fresh 13-month high at 11.85, which is 31 March 2022 high followed by 28 February 2022 high at 1.1246. On the flip side, a downside move below April 12 low at 1.0915 will drag the asset toward April 10 low at 1.0837 and April 03 low at 1.0788. EUR/USD hourly chart  EUR/USD  ",1
"AUD/USD stays on the front foot around 0.6640 as it defends the previous day’s gains after bouncing off a six-week low. In doing so, theAussiepair approaches the support-turned-resistance line stretched from early March, forming part of the previous bullish channel. It’s worth noting, however, that the bearish MACD signals and sluggish RSI (14), can challenge the AUD/USD bulls around the 0.6655 previous support. In a case where the Aussie buyers manage to cross the 0.6655 hurdle, its run-up towards the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the June-October 2022 downturn, near 0.6725, can’t be ruled out. However, the 100-DMA and the top line of the aforementioned channel, respectively near 0.6795 and 0.6835, can challenge the AUD/USD bulls afterward. Should the Aussie pair buyers manage to keep the reins past 0.6835, they can retake the driver’s seat. Meanwhile, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 0.6595 restricts the immediate downside of the AUD/USD pair. Following that, the yearly low marked in March around 0.6565 will be in the spotlight. If the AUD/USD bears manage to conquer the 0.6565 support, multiple levels near 0.6530-25 can challenge the Aussie pair’s downside before giving control to the sellers. Overall, AUD/USD remains on the bear’s radar even if the upside room appears limited. AUD/USD: Daily chart  Trend: Limited upside expected Additional important levels  ",1
"GBP/USDis flat in Tokyo following an impressive rally on Thursday in a continuation of the short squeeze. The bulls reached the prior resistance around 1.2500 and sit there currently waiting for a fresh impetus sat not far off a 10-month peak. financial market jitters have caused volatility this week as investors vacillated over whether U.S. banking issues and a standoff over the debt ceiling were overall supportive of the US Dollar. On Thursday, investors moved away from the Greenback ahead of the release of the first estimate of Q1Gross Domestic Productand weekly initial jobless claims. The data showed that while the US economy isforecastto have risen by 2% in Q1 after a 2.6% gain in the previous quarter, with personal consumption spending up 4.2% after a 1% gain to offset softer readings for other components, inflation remains sticky. The GDP Price Index for the US increased at an annualized rate of 4.0% in Q1, indicating inflation is stronger than initially expected.

"EUR/USDclings to mild losses near 1.1020 during early Friday in Europe as it tries to keep bears on the table after welcoming them the previous day. With this, the Euro pair aptly portrays the market’s anxiety ahead of the top-tier growth numbers from the bloc, as well as the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred inflation gauge. EUR/USD eased from the 13-month high on Thursday even after softer USGross Domestic Product(GDP) for the first quarter (Q1), not to forget mixed Eurozone sentiment numbers. The reason could be linked to the absence of commentary fromthe European Central Bank (ECB)and the Fed officials ahead of next week’s monetary policy meetings by these central banks. Also likely to have called the Euro sellers are the upbeat inflation signals from the GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Prices for Q1. Further, US banking fallout fears regain momentum amid reports that the First Republic Bank (FRB) plans to sell half its loan book to fill a $100B deposit flight gap, which in turn should have teased the EUR/USD sellers even if the tech giants kept the market optimistic. Elsewhere, the likely deadlock over the US debt ceiling talks, as most policymakers have contrasting views, also prods the optimists during the pre-data anxiety and restricts EUR/USD moves. Recently, House Speak Kevin McCarthy said, “I won't pass a clean debt-limit increase.” On the same line is the escalation in the geopolitical fears surrounding China. Earlier in the day, China’s Envoy to Japan said, “The issue surrounding Taiwan is a red line that should not be crossed.” Amid these plays, the S&P500 Futures remain directionless around mid-4,100s after rising the most in 1.5 months the previous day whereas the US Treasury bond yields grind higher and put a floor under the USDollar Index(DXY). Looking ahead, a likely improvement in the German andEurozoneGDP figures can challenge the EUR/USD sellers. However, the pair traders should wait for the US Core PCE Price Index for March, expected to ease to 4.5% YoY versus 4.6% prior, for clear directions. In a case where the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge print higher numbers, the major currency pair may decline heavily. Technical analysis EUR/USD pair’s retreat from an upward-sloping resistance line from early February, close to 1.1075 by the press time, keeps sellers hopeful amid sluggish oscillators. The pullback moves, however, remain elusive unless providing a daily close below a two-month-old ascending support line, near 1.0990 at the latest. Additional important levels  ",0

"USD/JPY rallies 100 pips to 134.45 on the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) inaction during early Friday.

That said, theBoJheld benchmark interestratesunchanged at -0.10% while also defending the latest 0.50% band of the Yield Curve Control (YCC), as expected.

Also read:Breaking: BoJ steers policy on a steady course, USD/JPY jumps Given the central bank officials’ latest defense of easy money policy matching the monetary policy inaction, the USD/JPY prices rise after the announcement. However, challenges to sentiment emanating from the First Republic Bank (FRB), US debt ceiling expiration woes and hawkish Fed bets led by recently upbeat US inflation signals seem to prod the USD/JPY pair buyers. It’s worth mentioning that the recent escalation in the geopolitical fears surrounding China also weighs on the sentiment and the USD/JPY prices. Earlier in the day, China’s Envoy to Japan said, “The issue surrounding Taiwan is a red line that should not be crossed.” While portraying the mood, the S&P500 Futures remain directionless around mid-4,100s after rising the most in 1.5 months the previous day whereas the US Treasury bond yields remain lackluster following a notable recovery in the 10-year and two-year bond coupons in the last two days. Having witnessed the initial reaction to the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) monetary policy announcements, the USD/JPY pair traders will pay attention to newly appointed Governor Kazuo Ueda’s press conference, scheduled at 06:30 AM GMT. Should the policymaker walks in the footprints of previous Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, the Yen pair may please buyers. Apart from the BoJ-linked catalysts, the market’s fears of banking fallouts and US default highlight the First Republic Bank (FRB) updates and discussion on debt ceiling expansion as important factors to watch. Additionally, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the US Core PCE Price Index for March, expected to ease to 4.5% YoY versus 4.6% prior, could offer more details to aptly predict the USD/JPY pair’s moves ahead of the next week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting.

"Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda is speaking at his first post-policy meeting conference on Friday, noting that it is “appropriate to continue monetary easing to achieve 2% inflation target in tandem with wage growth.” Additional quotes Won't hesitate to ease monetary policy further if necessary, Reorganized forward guidance given changes in govt's COVID-19 classification, lower the risk of pandemic's impact on economy, markets, Decided to conduct a broad-perspective review of monetary policy to deepen understanding of past policy conducts, gain informative insights for future policy. 'Review' is not aimed at conducting specific policy measures or changes in future. We can hope for stable, sustainable inflation to take hold. No idea what kind of policy our review will lead to. Review of monetary policy will also include input from external members. Policy review period of 1 to 1-1/2 years does not mean there will be no policy change during that time.

"The USD/JPY pair rallies over 250 pips from the daily low and jumps to its highest level since March 10, around the 135.85 area during the early part of the European session on Friday. The Japanese Yen (JPY) slumps across the board after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced its policy decision, which, along with resurgent US Dollar (USD) demand, prompts aggressive short-covering around the USD/JPY pair. As was widely expected, the Japanese central bank left its ultra-loose policy settings unchanged and also made no tweaks to its yield curve control (YCC) by a unanimous vote. The JPY selling picks up pace in reaction to theBoJGovernor Kazuo Ueda's dovish remarks, noting that it will be appropriate to continue monetary easing to achieve the 2% inflation target. Speaking at the post-meeting press conference, Udea added that the risk from tightening too hastily is larger thanmonetary policyfalling behind the curve and that Japan's inflation is likely to slow below 2% in the latter half of the year. The USD, on the other hand, climbs to a fresh weekly high and continues to draw support from firming expectations for a 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC policy meeting in May. The bets were reaffirmed by Thursday's US macroeconomic releases, which indicated persistent price pressures and that the US job market remains healthy despite an economic slowdown. This is seen as another factor pushing the USD/JPY pair. Apart from this, the strong intraday rally could further be attributed to some technical buying above the 135.00 psychological mark, which coincided with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the March downfall. This might have already set the stage for a further appreciating move, though bulls might wait for the release of the US Core PCE Price Index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - later this Friday.

Our expectations did not materialize as it traded sideways between 0.6596 and 0.6635. Momentumindicatorsare flattish and further sideways trading appears likely.

As highlighted, downward momentum is beginning to build and AUD is likely to edge lower in the coming days. However, any decline is likely to face solid support at the year-to-date low near 0.6565. All in all, AUD is likely to stay under pressure as long as 0.6670 (no change in ‘strong resistance’ from yesterday) is not breached.

"The Euro (EUR) is trading below the 1.1000 handle against the US Dollar (USD), after the release of German HICP inflation data, on Friday. Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the European Central Bank's prefered gauge of inflation, came in below expectations, reducing expectations the ECB will continue hiking rates aggressively at its May 4 meeting. EUR/USD trades at the lower boundary of a triangle threatening a downside breakout as traders speculate over the outcome of meetings held by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) andthe European Central Bank (ECB)next week, at which rate-setters will decide the future path of interestrates. The big question for the ECB is whether it will hike rates by 25 or a bigger 50 bps tranche. The lower-than-expected inflation print in Germany suggests it may be the former. Higher interest rates are positive for currencies since they increase demand from global investors looking for somewhere to park their money; the rate differential between the US andEurozoneis, therefore, a key determinant of the exchange rate. Other key factors influencing markets are lingering banking crisis fears as First Republic Bank fights for survival. From a technical standpoint, the overall trend is up and the probabilities favor long holders. EUR/USD market movers EUR/USD technical analysis: Triangle almost complete EUR/USDstays below the 1.1000 handle putting pressure on the base of a triangle pattern. Panning out and the broader medium-term uptrend remains intact – and will continue to – as long as the 1.0830 lows hold. Overall the odds favor a continuation of the dominant Euro bullish trend. EUR/USD: 4-hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, EUR/USD looks like it has completed a triangle pattern and is pressuring the baseline. Triangles are usually composed of five waves and the final wave E has reached the lower boundary line. Triangles can breakout in either direction but, given the dominant trend is bullish, the odds partially favor an upside breakout. As such, a decisive break above the 1.1095 year-to-date highs would confirm such a bullish breakout, and a continuation of the Euro’s uptrend to the next key resistance level at around 1.1190, where the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) is located. If the triangle fulfills its full price potential (based the height of the triangle at its widest point extrapolated higher) the Euro-US Dollar could even reach 1.1229. For the sake of clarity, a ‘decisive break’ could be defined as either a ‘breakout candle’ – a long green bullish daily candle that extends above the 1.1075 highs and closes near its high – or three smaller green bullish candles in a row that break above the highs. Alternatively, a break and daily close below the key 1.0909 lows would signify a bearish breakout from the triangle, with a target at 1.0805, which in itself could suggest a possible reversal of the dominant trend. Finally, the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) in the lower pane, is a mirror image of price, tracing out a little triangle of its own, and so giving no clues as to the underlying strength of the market or in which direction the eventual break will be. Euro FAQs What is the Euro? The Euro is the currency for the 20 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar.

What is the ECB and how does it impact the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy.The ECB’s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates – or the expectation of higher rates – will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa.The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. How does inflation data impact the value of the Euro? Eurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB’s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control.Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money. How does economic data influence the value of the Euro? Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency.A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall.Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone’s economy. How does the Trade Balance impact the Euro? Another significant data release for the Euro is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period.If a country produces highly sought after exports then its currency will gain in value purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance. ",0

On the latter, the German economy is expected to contract 0.1% YoY in Q1 and remain flat vs. the previous quarter. Adding to these poor results, the jobs report did not help either after the Unemployment Change rose more than estimated by 24K people amidst a steady jobless rate at 5.6%.

"Earlier today, the USD experienced a decline vs the EUR, GBP, andCHF, all of saw the greenback reach new lows. The USDJPY also trended lower. However, in recent trading, the USD has reversed course against the EUR, GBP, and CHF (gaining value) but continues to fall against the JPY. The market appears to be reacting to renewed concerns about the banking sector. The Dow Jones has dropped -160 points, and the S&P 500 is down -8.55 points (or 0.20%). In contrast, the NASDAQ remains higher, supported by Microsoft shares, currently up by 0.66%. Shares of First Republic, on the other hand, have plummeted by 39.26% to $4.92. In the US debt market, yields have turned negative, with the 2-year yield falling by 1.5 basis points to 3.8%. Similarly, the 10-year yield has dropped by 1.5 basis points to 3.381%.  Flight to safety flows seem to have resumed. Looking at the  hourly chart of the USDJPY, the pair is trading at 133.04, after touching a low of 133.009 (barely above the psychological support level of 133.00). The pair is now approaching its 100-day moving average of 132.95. The price had previously moved above the 100-day moving average on April 14, eventually reaching a high of 135.131 on April 19. The 100 day moving average is a key technical target. The hourly chart reveals that today's high briefly surpassed a resistance zone at 133.87 but failed to break through the subsequent 100-hour moving average (blue line currently at 134.023). The inability to breach this level, from a technical perspective, helped to maintain selling pressure and kept the sellers more in control at least in the short term. However, with the 100 day MA approaching traders will be evaluating the bias against  that key support level.  A move below would increase the bearish bias. Staying above will have traders eyeing the 38.2% at 133.395 as close resistance (see chart above).",0

"The AUD/USD pair attracts fresh selling near the 0.6640-0.6645 area on Friday and extends its intraday descent through the first half of the European session. The downward trajectory drags spot prices to the 0.6580-0.6575 region, or the lowest level since March 10, and is sponsored by resurgent US Dollar (USD) demand. In fact, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, climbs to a fresh weekly top and draws support from firming expectations for another 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May. The bets for additional rate hikes by the US central bank were reaffirmed by the US macro data released on Thursday, which indicated persistent inflationary pressures and that the US job market remains healthy despite an economic slowdown. Moreover, the Bank of Japan (BoJ)-inspired sell-off in the Japanese Yen (JPY), along with a generally weaker tone surrounding the equity markets, further benefit the safe-haven buck and drive flows away from the risk-sensitiveAussie. Apart from this,technical selling below the 0.6600 round-figure mark aggravates the bearish pressure and contributes to the AUD/USD pair's steep intraday decline. Spot prices now move back closer to the YTD low touched in March. Investors now look forward to the release of the US Core PCEPrice Index- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - due later during the early North American session. Given that the markets have been pricing in a pause in the Fed's rate-hiking cycle after May, a stronger reading might prompt aggressive short-covering around the USD and pave the way for a further depreciating move for the AUD/USD pair. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to register heavy weekly losses. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",0

The annual Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the European Central Bank's (ECB) preferred gauge of inflation, fell to 7.6% from 7.8% in the same period, compared to analysts' estimate of 7.8%.

"The USD/JPY pair builds on its strong intraday rally and climbs to its highest level since March 10, around the 136.40 region during the early North American session. Spot prices, however, retreat a few pips following the release of the US macro data and trade around the 136.00 mark, still up over 1.5% for the day. The Japanese Yen (JPY) turns out to be the worst-performing G10 currency on Friday in reaction to the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) decision to leave its ultra-loosemonetary policysettings unchanged. The Japanese central bank also made no tweaks to its yield curve control (YCC) by a unanimous vote, while theBoJGovernor sounded dovish during the post-meeting press conference. This, along with resurgent US Dollar (USD) demand, provides a goodish lift to the USD/JPY pair and further contributes to the intraday rally of over 300 pips. In fact, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, touches a two-and-half-week high amid firming expectations for another 25 bps lift-off at the next FOMC meeting in May. The USD, however, eases a bit after the US Bureau of EconomicAnalysisreported that the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index declined more than expected, to 4.2% on a yearly basis in March from 5.1% previously. The Core PCE Price Index (the Fed's preferred inflation gauge), meanwhile, edged lower to 4.6% from 4.7%. This, along with a sharp intraday decline in the US Treasury bond yields, keeps a lid on any further gains for the Greenback. Apart from this, the risk-off impulse - as depicted by a generally weaker tone around the equity markets - lends some support to the safe-haven JPY and acts as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair amid slightly overbought oscillators on hourly charts. Nevertheless, spot prices remain on track to register strong gains for the third successive week, also marking the fifth week of a positive move in the previous six.

The Core PCE Price Index (the Fed's preferred inflation gauge), meanwhile, edged lower to 4.6% from 4.7%. Apart from this, a steep intraday decline in the US Treasury bond yields contributes to keeping a lid on the USD and acts as a tailwind for the GBP/USD pair amid rising bets for another 25 bps rate hike by the Bank of England (BoE) in May. The markets, however, still seem convinced that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will go ahead with a 25 bps lift-off next week. This, along with the prevalent cautious market mood, continues to underpin the safe-haven buck and might cap the upside for the major. The aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before placing fresh bullish bets around theGBP/USD pairand positioning for any further near-term appreciating move.

"The AUDUSD experienced a decline during the Asian and early European trading sessions, following a successful test of the 100-hour Moving Average (MA) during the initial upward movement (refer to the blue line on the hourly chart above). This prompted traders to lean against the risk-defining level, leading to the currency pair's subsequent drop. The decline surpassed the lows from March 24 and April 11, ranging between 0.66188 and 0.66253, as well as the weekly lows between 0.6591 and 0.6595. The downward extension reached 0.6573 before reversing and moving back upwards. The currency pair is currently trading at 0.6615 and appears poised to retest the swing lows from March 24 and April 11 between 0.66188 and 0.66253. The subsequent 100-hour moving average is at 0.66295. If the price moves above both of these levels and then surpasses the day's high (which once again tested the 100-hour moving average), it will bolster buyer confidence. On the other hand, if sellers maintain pressure against this area, they will remain in firm control. Examining the daily chart below, we can see that sellers have been driving the price downwards over the past seven or so trading days, entering a swing area between 0.6544 and 0.65847.

EUR/USD climbed despite high inflation in the US, warrants higher rates Wall Street prints solid gains in the mid-day of the New York session. The US Department of Commerce revealed that the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) in March, rose by 4.6%, unchanged from February’s data. Therefore, further tightening is expected by the Federal Reserve, even though the headline figure slowed to 0.1% MoM less than the prior’s month 0.3%, and the annual figures slowed from 5.1% to 4.2%. In the initial reaction, the EUR/USD dipped to its daily low, but since then, the shared currency posted an 80-pip gain before stabilizing at current exchangerates. Other data reported from the University of Michigan (UoM), Consumer Sentiment, remained unchanged at 63.5, while Inflation expectations for 1-year stood at 4.6%, and for a 5-year horizon at 3%. Regarding the following week’s Federal Reserve’smonetary policymeeting, traders appeared convinced that the US central bank will increase rates by 25 bps, as shown by the CME FedWatch Tool odds of 88%. However, they remained skeptical about the Fed’s rhetoric of going higher for longer, as the swaps market estimates 50 bps rate cuts for the year’s second half. Therefore, the US Dollar seesawed between gains and losses, as shown by the USDollar Index, oscillating around 101.500s, registering minuscule gains of 0.10%. BBH analysts say, “Recent data have been dollar-supportive, but until rate cuts this year are finally priced out, the dollar is likely to remain vulnerable.” Across the pond, Germany’s GDP for Q4 improved to 0%, from Q3’s -0.4% contraction, but missed estimates of 0.2%. In the meantime, theEurozone(EU) reported GDP at 0.1% for Q4 and also missed the 0.2% projected by the consensus.

Having witnessed a slump in the First Republic shares and fleeing deposits from the US bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) finally took a tough decision to call in bids for the troubled bank. The same attracted multiple top-tier private organizations, including JP Morgan, to bid for the bank’s takeover. The results are up for release and can give only knee-jerk optimism as an immediate defense of the bank by a private player isn’t a solution to the broad banking problems. On the contrary, the same raises fears of such actions for the larger public banks in the future. During the weekend, China’s official NBS Manufacturing PMI disappointed markets with 49.2 figures for April, versus 51.4 market forecasts and 51.9 prior readings. It’s worth noting that the Non-Manufacturing PMI rose past 50.4 expected figures to 56.4 but remained below 58.4 reported in March. With the downbeat numbers from Australia’s biggest customer, as well as the banking fears, the AUD/USD pair remains pressured of late. In the last week, headline inflation numbers from Australia have disappointed theAussiepair buyers, on both the monthly and the quarterly format. The same joins the RBA’s latest pause in the rate hike trajectory to raise the odds of witnessing one more status quote decision by the Australian central bank. On the other hand, the first readings of the USGross Domestic Product(GDP) for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023, also known as Advance readings, marked mixed outcomes. That said, the headline US GDP Annualized eased to 1.1% from 2.0% expected and 2.6% prior but the GDP Price Index inched higher to 4.0% on an annualized basis from 3.9% prior and 3.8% market consensus. Further, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, for March matched 0.3% market forecasts and prior to MoM but rose to 4.6% from 4.5% expected on YoY, with an upwardly revised previous reading of 4.7%. On the same line, the US Employment Cost Index also increased by 1.2% in Q1 2023, versus the 1% increase marked previously. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures print mild losses even as Wall Street closed positive and the yields eased. Moving on, AUD/USD pair may remain pressured amid the market’s cautious mood ahead of the top-tier data/events, as well as due to the sour sentiment. However, major attention will be given to theRBAand Fed moves as a monetary policy divergence appears to brew. Technical analysis Unless rising back beyond the previous support line stretched from early March, close to 0.6665 by the press time, the AUD/USD pair is well-set to refresh the yearly high of around 0.6565.

"EUR/USD remains depressed for the third consecutive day while staying around the highest levels since April 2022, mildly offered near 1.1010 during Monday’s Asian session. In doing so, the Euro pair bears the burden of the recently easing hawkish bets onthe European Central Bank (ECB), as well as the strong inflation signals from the US. Also challenging the pair buyers at the multi-month high are the economic slowdown fears and the First Republic woes. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) calls in bids for the troubled US bank after an exodus of withdrawals caused First Republic's share price to tank. That said, multiple top-tier private organizations, including JP Morgan, bid for the bank’s takeover. The results are up for release and can give only knee-jerk optimism as an immediate defense of the bank by a private player isn’t a solution to the broad banking problems. On the contrary, the same raises fears of such actions for the larger public banks in the future and hence can keep the risk-off mood intact. Elsewhere, ECB hawks retreat amid downbeat EU and German statistics released in the last week. On Friday, preliminary readings of Germany’s inflation for April, as per the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) index, eased to 7.6% YoY versus 7.8% expected and prior. Further, the nation’s inflation per the Consumer Price Index (CPI) also softened to 7.2% YoY compared to 7.3% market consensus and 7.4% previous readings. Further, the first readings of theEurozoneGross Domestic Product (GDP) for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023 came in mixed for QoQ and YoY. That said, the Eurozone Q1 GDP improved to 0.1% QoQ from 0.0% prior, versus 0.2% expected, whereas the yearly growth eased to 1.3% from 1.4% market forecasts and 1.8% prior. On the same line, Germany’s Q1 GDP improved on a quarterly basis, to 0.0% from -0.4% prior and 0.2% analysts’ estimations, whereas the yearly figures dropped to -0.1% from 0.9% previous readings and 0.3% market forecasts. Alternatively, initial estimations of the USGross Domestic Product(GDP) for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023, also known as Advance readings, marked mixed outcomes. That said, the headline US GDP Annualized eased to 1.1% from 2.0% expected and 2.6% prior but the GDP Price Index inched higher to 4.0% on an annualized basis from 3.9% prior and 3.8% market consensus. Further, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index, for March matched 0.3% market forecasts and prior to MoM but rose to 4.6% from 4.5% expected on YoY, with an upwardly revised previous reading of 4.7%. On the same line, the US Employment Cost Index also increased by 1.2% in Q1 2023, versus the 1% increase marked previously. Amid these plays, the CME Group FedWatch Tool suggests higher odds of the Fed’s 0.25% rate hike in May and June, as well as a reduction in the market’s bets on the September rate cut from the US central bank. With this, S&P 500 Futures print mild losses even as Wall Street closed positive and the yields eased. Moving on, holidays in multiple European markets on Monday may restrict EUR/USD moves even as the US ISM Manufacturing PMI is up for release. However, major attention will be given to Wednesday’s Fed meeting, Thursday’s ECB monetary policy announcements and Friday’s US jobs report for April. Overall, bulls appear running out of steam but bears have a tough task retaking control. Technical analysis The overbought RSI (14) line joins theEUR/USDpair’s repeated failure to provide a daily closing beyond 1.1050 to lure the sellers. However, an upward-sloping trend line from early April, close to 1.0980, holds the gate for sellers. Additional important levels  ",0

The Bank of Japan kept its easing policy on Friday and the Yen has weakened to a 7-week low against the US Dollar as the BoJ decision re-ignites emphasis on US Treasuries and the Federal Reserve. The BoJ kept monetary policy unchanged and said it would “patiently” continue with monetary easing. The members voted 9-0 to maintain its policy balance rate at 0.1% and keep its 10-year JGB yield target at about 0%. At the same time, the BoJ cut its 2023 JapanGross Domestic Productestimate to 1.4% from a previous estimate of 1.7% and raised its 2023 core Consumer Price Index estimate to 1.8% from 1.6%. Meanwhile, the BoJ scrapped its forward guidance on interestratesand said it would patiently continue with monetary easing. Also, Governor KazuoUedasaid the Japanese economy faces a bigger risk from premature tightening than from a delay. ´´While giving BoJ more flexibility, we continue to think that a move in YCC is not that far off. A June move is probably too early now, but a shift later in H2 2023 still looks likely,´´ analysts at TD Securities explained. ´´While the 1-1.5y time frame for the BoJ review is much longer than expected, it is not clear that this will be overwhelmingly bearish for the yen.´´ ´´USD/JPY extended its upward momentum into Ueda's press conference, but we would expect strategic interest to fade into 137 (~200dma).´´ ´´This market is asymmetric with a preference to hold on to a receiver bias in the US. We have also seen tests into 3.60% in US10s as a solid point to fade. It's not obvious that the BOJ will remain idle for 1-1.5 years on YCC. But the Fed is very likely going to be cutting then,´´ the analysts added. In data, meanwhile, Japan's March Industrial Production fell -0.7% YoY, a smaller decline than expectations of -1.2% YoY.

"The GBP/USD pair is aiming to claim the round-level resistance of 1.2600 in the Asian session. The Cable has corrected marginally after failing to sustain above 1.2580. However, the scale of correction in the Cable is critically low in comparison with the recovery in the USDollar Index(DXY), which indicates that Pound Sterling is holding some strength. S&P500 futures have trimmed losses generated in early Asia as investors are focusing again on solid quarterly results reported by United States tech-savvy companies. A recovery in the risk appetite of the market participants is expected to improve the appeal for risk-perceived assets. The USD Index is facing barricades in extending its recovery above 101.80. The greenback index slipped sharply on Friday despite a consistent increase in consumer spending. March’s core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE)Price Indexlanded at 0.3%, consistent with consensus and the former release. Resilience in spending outlays for core goods and services indicates that inflation would remain persistent and the Federal Reserve (Fed) is needed to stay affirmed on its path of policy-tightening. On Monday, US ISM Manufacturing PMI data will be in focus. Investors are anticipating mild gains in PMI figures to 46.6 vs. the prior release of 46.3. New Orders Index data that indicates forward demand is expected to jump to 45.5 from the former release of 44.3. On thePound Sterlingfront, the street is anticipating that the Bank of England (BoE) will keep its policy-tightening spell continuing to arrest United Kingdom’s double-digit inflation figure. UK’s inflationary pressures are extremely stubborn and showing no signs of deceleration amid a labor shortage and consistently elevating food prices. GBP/USD  ",1
"USD/JPY buyers prod the 200-DMA hurdle as they push the limits of a two-month high near 137.00 during early Monday. In doing so, the Yen pair rises for the third consecutive day while cheering the previous day’s upside break of a downward-sloping resistance line from the last November, now the immediate support, as well as the bullish MACD signals. However, the 200-DMA level surrounding the 137.00 round figure joins the overbought RSI (14) line to challenge the USD/JPY bulls of late. Even if the Yen pair manages to overcome the 137.00 hurdle, a horizontal region comprising multiple levels marked since early December 2022, between 137.90 and 138.20, will be crucial for the pair buyers to watch. Should the quote manages to remain firmer past 138.20, the odds of witnessing the USD/JPY rally targeting a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the October 2022 to January 2023 downturn, near 142.55, will be in the spotlight. Alternatively, USD/JPY pullback remains elusive unless the quote stays beyond the resistance-turned-support line, around 135.85 by the press time. Even if the Yen pair drops below 135.85, the mid-April swing high around 135.15 and the five-week-old ascending support line near 133.70 could challenge the USD/JPY bears. Overall, USD/JPY is likely to remain firmer but the quote’s additional rise depends upon a 138.20 breakout. USD/JPY: Daily chart  Trend: Pullback expected Additional important levels  ",1
"The AUD/USD pair is looking to surpass the crucial resistance of 0.6640 in the Asian session. TheAussieasset has stretched its rally as the US Dollar Index (DXY) is struggling in extending its recovery above 101.80. The Australian Dollar will be required immense strength for conquering the 0.6640 amid anxiety ahead of themonetary policyby the Federal Reserve (Fed). S&P500 futures are having some gains in the Asian session after a bullish Friday, portraying positivemarket sentiment. An attempt of rescuing First Republic Bank by private lenders has eased US banking jitters. JP Morgan and PNC are submitting a final bid for First Republic Bank in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) auction. The USDollar Index(DXY) is facing barricades in extending its rally above 101.80 as investors are divided over further movement. One more interest rate hike of 25 basis points (bps) from the Fed is widely expected as the United States' core inflationary pressures are critically persistent. However, investors will keenly focus on guidance on interestrates. But before that, US ISM Manufacturing PMI will keep USD Index in action. Investors are anticipating mild gains in PMI figures to 46.6 vs. the prior release of 46.3. New Orders Index data that indicates forward demand is expected to jump to 45.5 from the former release of 44.3. On the Australian Dollar front, Tuesday’s interest rate decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will be in focus.

"The EUR/USD pairhas found an intermediate cushion after a steep correction to near the psychological support of 1.1000. The major currency pair is defending its downside as investors as the USDollar Index(DXY) is facing barricades in extending its recovery significantly above 101.80. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is failing to attract more bids as investors are divided due to expectations of neutral interest rate guidance from the Federal Reserve (Fed). A consecutive 25 basis point (bp) interest rate hike from the Fed cannot be ruled out, however, further roadmap seems less bumpy amid easing United States inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures have added more gains in early London, portraying further improvement in the risk appetite. The 10-year US Treasury yields seem sideways above 3.45%. Investors should brace a volatile action from the USD Index amid the release of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI (April) data. As per the consensus, the economic data is seen higher at 46.6 from the former release of 46.3. A figure below 50.0 is considered a contraction in manufacturing activities and consistency with consensus will make it the sixth consecutive contracting month. Apart from that, New Orders data indicates forward demand is seen expanding to 45.5 vs. the prior release of 44.3. On theEurozonefront, preliminaryGross Domestic Product(GDP) expanded by 0.1% in the first quarter while the street was anticipating an expansion of 0.2%. The shared continent has managed to doge contraction anyhow but the risk of recession has cemented. Annual GDP expanded by 1.3% lower than the estimates of 1.4% and the former release of 1.8%.

"USD/JPY bulls are in the driver’s seat even as holidays in multiple markets challenge the momentum during early Monday. That said, the Yen pair prods the 137.00 round figure while refreshing the highest levels since early March by the press time. While checking the Yen pair’s latest up-moves, the biggest in 2023, a divergence between themonetary policyoutlook of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could be considered the key catalyst. Following that, downbeat Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields and the US Dollar’s broad run-up also gain the attention of the USD/JPY pair watchers. Furthermore, cautious optimism in the market, amid hopes that the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will be able to defend the First Republic Bank also propel the Yen pair. It’s worth noting that final readings of Japan’s Jibun Bank Manufacturing PMI for April confirmed the initial 49.5 figures, showing a contraction in activities, while the Japanese Consumer Confidence Index for the said month improved to 35.4 from 33.9 prior and 32.4 market forecasts. On the other hand, the recently upbeat prints of the US Core PCE Price Index and early signals of the US inflation have propelled the hawkish Fed bets and underpinned the US Dollar’s rebound. That said, the USDollar Index(DXY) renews its intraday high near 101.85 during a three-day uptrend by the press time. Against this backdrop,market sentimentremains cautiously optimistic as the Fed’s 0.25% rate hike is already given and the First Republic bank-led wounds are likely to be overcome soon. Adding to the slightly positive mood, as well as the USD/JPY upside, could be the absence of traders from Europe, the UK, China and India, which in turn eases the recession talks and allow markets to consolidate previous pessimism. Above all, the BoJ’s inaction on Friday and the newly appointed Governor Kazuo Ueda’s defense of the easy-money policy by saying, that it is “appropriate to continue monetary easing to achieve 2% inflation target in tandem with wage growth,” keeps USD/JPY buyers hopeful. That said, the BoJ dropped its forward guidance for interestratesand launched a review of its policies that will take more than a year, which in turn might have also fuelled the USD/JPY prices of late. Moving on, a light calendar on Monday and holidays in multiple markets, together with a technical breakout, may allow the USD/JPY bulls to keep the reins with eyes on the US ISM Manufacturing PMI for April for intraday directions. Technical analysis Considering the overbought RSI, the 200-DMA near 137.00, quickly followed by the 137.90-138.20 resistance zone comprising multiple levels marked since early December 2022, to challenge the USD/JPY buyers.

"The AUD/USD pair attracts some buyers on the first day of a new week and builds on Friday's bounce from the 0.6575-0.6570 area, or its lowest level since March 10. Spot prices build on the steady intraday ascent through the early European session and climb to a four-day high, closer to mid-0.6600s in the last hour. Traders opt to lighten their bets ahead of this week's key central bank event risks, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the AUD/USD pair amid relatively thin liquidity conditions on the back of a holiday in Europe. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is scheduled to announce itsmonetary policydecision on Tuesday. This will be followed by the outcome of the highly-anticipated two-day FOMC meeting on Wednesday. The upside for the AUD/USD pair, however, seems limited amid a modest US Dollar (USD) strength, bolstered by the prospects for another 25 bps lift-off by the Federal Reserve (Fed).  Apart from this, looming recession fears drive some haven flow towards the Greenback and act as a headwind for the risk-sensitiveAussie. Furthermore, weaker Chinese manufacturing data released on Sunday might contribute to capping the AUD/USD pair. In fact, the official Chinese Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), released on Sunday, declined to 49.2 in April from 51.9 in March. The data comes amid worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs and tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets, which is evident from the cautious mood around the equity markets. This warrants some caution before placing bullish bets around the AUD/USD pair. Market participants now look to the release of the USISM Manufacturing PMI, due later during the early North American session. This, along with the broader risk sentiment, should influence the USD price dynamics and contribute to producing short-term trading opportunities around the AUD/USD pair.

"TheGBP/USD paircomes under some selling pressure on the first day of a new week and erodes a part of Friday's strong gains to the 1.2580-1.2585 region, or its highest level since June 2022. Spot prices extend the steady intraday descent through the early part of the European session and drop to a fresh daily low, around the 1.2520 area in the last hour. A combination of supporting factors assists the US Dollar (USD) to gain positive traction for the third successive day, which, in turn, is seen dragging the GBP/USD pair lower. The prospects of the Federal Reserve (Fed) raising interest rates by another 25 basis points (bps) at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, along with looming recession risks, continue to act as a tailwind for the safe-haven Greenback. China's official ManufacturingPMIdeclined to 49.2 in April from 51.9 in March. This comes on the back of the Advance US  GDP report released last week, which showed that growth in the world's largest economy decelerated more than expected during the first quarter. This, in turn, adds to worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs and drives some haven flows towards the buck. The markets, however, seem convinced that the US central bank will then holdratessteady for the rest of the year beyond May, which might hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. Apart from this, rising bets for a 25 bps lift-off by the Bank of England (BoE) might further contribute towards limiting the downside for the GBP/USD pair, warranting some caution before positioning for any further downfall. Traders might also prefer to wait on the sidelines amid relatively thin trading volumes on the back of a holiday in Europe and ahead of the highly-anticipated two-day FOMC policy meeting, starting on Tuesday. The Fed is scheduled to announce its decision on Wednesday, which will play a key role in influencing the USD price dynamics and help determine the near-term trajectory for the GBP/USD pair. In the meantime, traders on Monday will take cues from the release of the USISM Manufacturing PMI, due later during the early North American session.

"The USD/JPY pair builds on Friday's blowout rally and gains strong follow-through traction on the first day of a new week. The momentum lifts spot prices to the highest level since March 10, though pauses near a technically significant 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) resistance just ahead of the 137.00 mark. The pair, however, maintains its bid tone through the first half of the European session and is currently placed just above mid-136.00s, still up around 0.25% for the day. The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to be weighed down by the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) dovish outlook, which, along with a modest US Dollar (USD) strength, acts as a tailwind for the USD/JPY pair. It is worth recalling that the Japanese central bank on Friday left its ultra-loose monetary policy settings unchanged and also made no tweaks to its yield curve control (YCC) by a unanimous vote. Adding to this, the new BoJ Governor KazuoUedasaid that the risk from tightening too hastily is larger thanmonetary policyfalling behind the curve and added that it will be appropriate to continue monetary easing to achieve the 2% inflation target. Apart from this, data released earlier this Monday showed that factory activity in Japan - the world's third-biggest economy - contracted for the sixth straight month in April, which, in turn, exerts additional downward pressure on the JPY. The USD, on the other hand, edges higher for the third successive day amid the prospects of the Federal Reserve (Fed) raising interestratesby another 25 basis points (bps) at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The markets, however, seem convinced that the US central bank will then hold rates steady for the rest of the year. This holds back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and caps the pair. Furthermore, worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs could lend some support to the safe-haven JPY and contribute to keeping a lid on the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. In fact, the Advance USD GDP report released last week showed that growth in the world's largest economy slowed more than expected in the first quarter. Moreover, the official Chinese Manufacturing PMI declined to 49.2 in April from 51.9 in March and further fueled recession fears. Market participants now look forward to the release of the USISM Manufacturing PMI, due later during the early North American session. Apart from this, the broader market risk sentiment might further contribute to producing short-term opportunities around the USD/JPY pair. The focus, meanwhile, will remain glued to the outcome of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday and the closely-watched US monthly employment details, popularly known as theNFPreport on Friday.

"TheGBP/USD pairattracts some buying in the vicinity of the 1.2500 psychological mark on Monday and turns neutral during the early part of the North American session. The pair is currently placed around the 1.2550 region and remains well within the striking distance of its highest level since June 2022 touched on Friday. The US Dollar (USD) surrenders a major part of its modest intraday gains amid the uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-hike path and turns out to be a key factor lending some support to the GBP/USD pair. In fact, the markets have fully priced in another 25 bps lift-off at the end of a two-day FOMCmonetary policymeeting on Wednesday, which remains supportive of a modest uptick in the US Treasury bond yields and acts as a tailwind for the USD. Investors, however, seem convinced that the US central bank will then hold rates steady for the rest of the year, which, in turn, holds back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. Apart from this, firming expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will also hike interestratesby 25 bps in May assists the GBP/USD pair to attract some dip-buying at lower levels, though the upside seems limited ahead of the highly-anticipated FOMC meeting, starting on Tuesday. Furthermore, looming recession risks might continue to benefit the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and contribute to capping gains for the GBP/USD pair, at least for the time being. From a technical perspective, Friday's sustained breakthrough and acceptance above the 1.2500 psychological mark, along with the emergence of some dip-buying on Monday, favours bulls and suggests that the path of least resistance for spot prices is to the upside. Next on tap is the release of the USISM Manufacturing PMI. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, will drive the USD demand and provide some meaningful impetus to the GBP/USD pair. The immediate market reaction, however, is more likely to remain limited, warranting some caution before placing aggressive directional bets. Technical levels to watch GBP/USD  ",0

"The GBPUSD is trading to a new session low after the better-than-expected ISM manufacturing data, and in the process looks toward the 1.2500 natural support level. The 38.2% retracement of the move up from the April 17 low is also in play near that natural support at 1.24951. A swing area going back to April 12 to April 14 is between 1.2495 and 1.2500.

"TheEUR/USDdropped below 1.1000 after the ISM announced that manufacturing activity in April improved. However, it stood in contractionary territory, while a measure of inflation in the same data increased. Therefore, speculations for further tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) underpinned the US Dollar (USD). At the time of writing, the EUR/USD is trading at 1.0969 after hitting a high of 1.1035. EUR/USD losses traction and creeps lower on US data A risk-on impulse dominates the US equity markets, courtesy of JP Morgan's acquiring the troubled First Republic Bank. However, that's not happening in the FX space, as the EUR/USD fell after the ISM Manufacturing PMI for April improved to 47.1 from 46.3 in the prior's month. While there were improvements in the Orders and Production subcomponents, they fell short of reaching expansionary territory. The Prices Index increased by 4 points to 53.2, which led to speculation that the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policies in the upcoming Wednesday. Therefore, the EUR/USD retraced, past the daily pivot point and beneath the S1 daily pivot, at 1.0970. It should be said that the greenback underpinned by higher US T-bond yields, its printing losses of 0.46%, up at 102.149. As of writing, comments from the IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Monday said, ""De-dollarization isn't on top of my worry list."" She added, ""There may be more vulnerabilities exposed in the banking sector,"" and warned that they would see quite a lot of regulatory and disclosure thinking in the wake of the banking crisis. An absent Eurozone's (EU) economic docket kept EUR/USD traders leaning on the American Dollar (USD) dynamics andmarket sentiment. On Tuesday, the EU's agenda will feature inflation figures and the HCOB Manufacturing PMI in its final reading. The US economic calendar would feature the JOLTs Job Openings report and Factory Orders ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reservemonetary policydecision. EUR/USD Technical Analysis  From a technical perspective, the EUR/USD is still upward biased but about to test the 20-day EMA at 1.0955. A fall below the latter will expose the 1.0900 figure, followed by the 50-day EMA at 1.0856. Conversely, if EUR/USD buyers reclaim 1.1000, further upside is warranted at around 1.1095. EUR/USD  ",1
"The USD/JPY extends its gains in the New York session, rising above 137.00 on overall Japanese Yen (JPY) weakness after last week’s Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) decision to stick to its easymonetary policy. Therefore, the USD/JPY is trading at 137.42 after hitting a daily low of 136.11. USD/JPY Price Action From a daily chart perspective, the USD/JPY continues to trend up after last Friday’s price action witnessed more than 1.70% gains. As the pair edged higher, it broke several resistance levels, like the 20 and 100-day EMAs, each at 134.14 and 134.12, respectively. Additionally, the USD/JPY left behind the 200-day EMA at 133.79, cheered by buyers, who remain hopeful of lifting prices towards the last year’s high at 151.94. If USD/JPY reclaims the November 30 cycle high at 138.17, that would expose the November 21 daily high at 142.25. A breach of the latter will expose the 145.00 figure. Conversely, if USD/JPY drops below 137.00, it could pave the way for a downward correction. Once cleared, the USD/JPY following support would be the April 28 high at 136.56. Downside risks will emerge below the latter, and it might extend towards the April 19 swing high at 135.13, followed by the 20-day EMAat 134.14, closely followed by the 100-day EMA.

To start the US trading day, the EURUSD was mired in a low 30 pip trading range. The buyers took the price above the 100 hour MA in the early NY session, but after a stronger ISM data highlighted by higher prices paid component, the price action reversed, the price fell back below the 100 and 200 hour MA (green line) at the natural support at 1.1000.

The low to high trading range is now 72 pips which is within shouting distance of what has been the average over the last month (82 pips).

"The Australian Dollar (AUD) clings to some gains after hitting a daily high of 0.6668, though renewed US Dollar (USD) strength spurred a dip toward current exchangerates. That was sparked by the latest week’s inflation data, alongside an improvement in manufacturing activity. At the time of writing, the AUD/USD is trading at 0.6635. AUD/USD oscillates around 0.6620s as traders brace for the Federal Reserve’s decision Wall Street portrays an upbeatmarket sentimentafter JP Morgan acquired the failed lender First Republic Bank. Market participants were bracing for another hike by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and weighed on the AUD/USD’s pair. A report by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) revealed the ManufacturingPMIfor April at 47.1, improving from March’s 46.3 but missed the chance to enter the expansionary territory. One of the subcomponents of the ISM’s poll, the Prices Index, surprisingly jumped to 53.2 from 49, indicating that inflation is picking up amongst US factories. In the meantime, the USDollar Index(DXY), a gauge for the buck’s value vs. a basket of six currencies, advances 0.43%, up at 102.112, a headwind for the AUD/USD pair. US Treasury bond yields climbed and underpinned the buck, as shown by the DXY Aside from this, the Fed’s odds for a 25 bps rate hike stand at 88.9%, as shown by the CME Fed Watch Tool. Aside from this, over the weekend, data from China increased concerns about its growth, with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealing that the Manufacturing PMI in April slowed down from 51.9 to 49.2. The Non- Manufacturing PMI rose to 56.4, down from 58.2 in March, while the composite Index stood at 54.4, from 57. “A lack of market demand and the high-base effect from the quick manufacturing recovery in the first quarter” was among the factors that led to the contraction in April, said senior NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe. Even though China’s outlook looks gloomy, theAUD/USDheld to its earlier gains. Data from Australia witnessed the Judo Bank Manufacturing PMI rising to 48, below the prior’s month 49.1, while the TD-MI inflation gauge rose by 0.2%, below the latest month’s 0.3%. In further data, Australia’s Labor government will reveal a vast improvement in the country’s budget bottom line next week, which has been helped by tax windfalls and job gains. Nevertheless, Treasurer Jim Chalmers has warned that fiscal challenges persist, and the government aims to be responsible with spending to avoid inflation, particularly since the Reserve Bank of Australia is aggressively lifting interest rates.

"The AUDUSD moved higher in trading today. In the Asian session, the price extended above its 100 hour moving average (blue line in the chart above), and that ignited more buying interest early on. The momentum picked up as the US session began. That momentum took the the price above another swing area near 0.6649 to 0.6652 and then the downward sloping 200 hour moving average at 0.6660 (green line in the chart above). The high price today reached through the 200 hour moving average to a high of 0.66676, but momentum faded and when the price moved back below the 200 hour moving average, buyers turned to sellers. The move lower was held by stronger than expected ISM data Now the price is making new US session lows and approaches the low price going back to March 24 at 0.66253. Below that, sellers will target the swing low from at 0.66188 followed by the 100 hour moving average of 0.66173. It would now take a move below the 100 hour moving average to put the sellers fully in control. Between the 100/200 hour moving average (like now) is neutral in the short-term with a tilt more to the downside (especially after failing above the 200 hour moving average).

"What you need to know on Tuesday, May 2: Financial markets were quite volatile Monday, despite most major countries celebratingLabour Day, keeping local markets closed. The US Dollar edged higher against its rivals, initially extending Friday’s gains and later taking advantage of better-than-anticipated American data. On Friday, month-end flows and position readjusting ahead of the multiple first-tier events this week pushed the Greenback higher. The rally continued at the beginning of the week but reverted during European hours, with thin volumes exacerbating the movements. It later resumed its advance following the release of US figures. The United States (US) April ISM ManufacturingPMIimproved more than anticipated, up to 47.1 from 46.3. Also, March Construction Spending rose by 0.3% MoM, better than the 0.1% decline expected by market players. Not so encouraging, the final estimate of the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for the same month was downwardly revised from 50.4 to 50.2. The US Dollar was also supported byrising US government bond yields. The 10-year Treasury note currently yields 360%, up 15 basis points (bps), while the 2-year note offers 4.13%, adding roughly 7 bps on Monday. Meanwhile, central banks take center stage. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced its decision on Friday, and as widely anticipated, it left its interest rates unchanged in newly appointed Governor Kazuo Ueda’s first policy meeting. The central bank also kept the range for 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGB) unchanged at 50 basis points, around the 0% target. TheReserve Bank of Australia(RBA) will be next, as it will announce its decision on Tuesday. The RBA is expected to pause rate hikes and maintain the cash rate at 3.50%. The United States (US) Federal Reserve (Fed) will be out on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank (ECB) will follow on Thursday. Meanwhile, Wall Street advanced following news that JP Morgan bought most First Republic Bank assets, rescuing the troubled institution with blessings from the US regulator, the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). As for US data, the April ISM Manufacturing PMI improved more than anticipated, up to 47.1 from 46.3.

"The EUR/USD pairis hovering near the eight-day-old support of 1.0960 in the early Asian session. The major currency pair is expected to display a sheer sell-off after breaking below the same. The downside bias for the shared currency pair looks solid as the USDollar Index(DXY) is preparing for a fresh rally above 102.20 amid themonetary policyby the Federal Reserve (Fed), which will be announced on Wednesday. S&P500 surrendered gains in the late New York session and ended Monday with some losses, portraying caution among market participants ahead of the Fed’s interest rate policy. Investors failed to capitalize on this despite easing United States banking jitters as JP Morgan buyout First Republic Bank from US regulators. The USD Index has recaptured two-week-old resistance of 102.20 and is expected to remain in the driving seat as Fed policymakers are preparing for one more 25 basis points (bps) interest rate hike. Meanwhile, the US ISM Manufacturing PMI (April) remained upbeat on Monday. The Manufacturing PMI continued to remain below the 50.0 threshold consecutively for the sixth month but rebounded from the annual lowest figure to 47.1. Also, New Orders Index improved to 45.7 from the consensus of 45.5. On theEurozonefront, weak economic growth amid higher inflation is becoming a major problem for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers. The shared continent has recorded a growth rate of 0.1% in the first quarter lower than the consensus of 0.2%.

"AUD/USD remains pressured near 0.6630-25 during the early hours of Tuesday’s Asian session, after paring the daily gains amid late Monday. In doing so, theAussiepair portrays the trader’s anxiety ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA)monetary policydecision. The Aussie pair began the week on a firmer footing despite mixed data at home and in China. However, hopes of overcoming immediate challenges to themarket sentimentfrom the First Republic Bank (FRB), which was finally dealt with, helped the risk barometer pair to remain firmer. On Sunday, China’s official NBS Manufacturing PMI disappointed markets with 49.2 figures for April, versus 51.4 market forecasts and 51.9 prior readings. It’s worth noting that the Non-Manufacturing PMI rose past 50.4 expected figures to 56.4 but remained below 58.4 reported in March. With the downbeat numbers from Australia’s biggest customer, as well as the banking fears, the AUD/USD pair remains pressured of late. At home, Australia’s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for April eased to 48.1 versus 48.0 prior while TD Securities Inflation eased to 0.2% on MoM for the said month from 0.3% but improved to 6.1% YoY from 5.7% previous. Elsewhere, the US regulators seized assets of the FRB and sold them to the new buyer, namely JP Morgan. “JPMorgan will pay $10.6 billion to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) as part of the deal to take control of most of the San Francisco-based bank's assets and get access to First Republic's coveted wealthy client base,” said Reuters. On the other hand, US ISM Manufacturing PMI improved to 47.1 for April versus 46.3 prior and 46.6 market forecasts while the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for the said month eased to 50.2 versus 50.4 first estimations. It should be noted that Friday’s upbeat US inflation clues via Core PCE Price Index joined the solution on First Republic Bank to underpin the market’s optimism. The same helped the Wall Street and AUD/USD prices. Further, the US Treasury bond yields also began the key week on a positive footing and allowed the US Dollar to extend the previous gains. Looking forward, all eyes are on the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Interest Rate Decision even as the market players expect no change in the benchmark interest rate or other monetary policy measures. The reason could be linked to the doubts over the Aussie central bank’s interest rate peak, which some in the market expected around 3.65%, versus the 3.60% level at the latest. Hence, the rate guidance and economic forecasts will be crucial to watch for AUD/USD traders in today’sRBAannouncements.

"USD/JPY remains sidelined after refreshing a two-month high,  dropping to 137.30 during early Tuesday. In doing so, the Yen pair portrays the cautious mood ahead of the key US data/events amid the full market’s return, after Monday’s holiday in major bourses. Also underpinning the pair’s upside could be the recently firmer US Treasury bond yields, as well as risk-positive headlines surrounding the First Republic Bank. However, the recent fears about the US debt ceiling expiration seem to prod the quote even if the Bank of Japan (BoJ) doves contrasts with the hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) bets to defend the USD/JPY bulls. Reuters came out with the news suggesting the US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s push for an expedited process to consider a clean two-year suspension of the federal debt ceiling. Fueling the US diplomat’s move is the Treasury Department’s recent updates of the default by pulling forward the date of running out of funds to match obligations if the current debt ceiling isn’t altered by June 01, previously signaled as July. “US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter to Congress that the agency may be unable to meet all of its debt obligations as soon as June 1 if the debt ceiling is not raised, putting new urgency on talks in Congress,” said Reuters. The same triggered chatters of US President Joe Biden’s call to four top US diplomats and arranging a meeting on May 09 made rounds. Further, US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy mentioned that there is a bill sitting in the Senate as we speak that would put the risk of default to rest. Previously, hawkish Fed bets and the BoJ’s defense of the ultra-easymonetary policy, backed by the upbeat US inflation clues via the Core PCE Price Index propel the USD/JPY prices to renew a multi-day high. On the same line could be the US regulators’ seizing of the First Republic Bank’s assets and selling them to the new buyer, namely JP Morgan. “JPMorgan will pay $10.6 billion to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) as part of the deal to take control of most of the San Francisco-based bank's assets and get access to First Republic's coveted wealthy client base,” said Reuters. Against this backdrop, Wall Street closed with gains even if the S&P 500 Futures printed mild losses of late. Further, the US Treasury bond yields began the key week on a positive footing and allowed the US Dollar to extend the previous gains. Moving on, the return of the full markets and cautious sentiment may prod the USD/JPY buyers ahead of US Factory Orders for March, expected to rise by 0.8% MoM versus -0.7% prior. However, the monetary policy divergence between theBoJand the Fed can keep the Yen pair bulls hopeful. Technical analysis Be it the descending resistance line from mid-December 2022 or the Year-To-Date (YTD) high marked in March, the 137.75-90 has it all to challenge the USD/JPY bulls. Also challenging the Yen pair buyers are the overbought conditions of the RSI (14) line. Additional important levels  ",0

Also read:AUD/USD eases towards 0.6600 with eyes on RBA Interest Rate Decision Not only the AUD/USD pair’s U-turn from a short-term resistance line but the inability to cross the previous support line from early March, now immediate resistance near 0.6655, also keeps the Aussie pair sellers hopeful. Furthermore, the MACD signals appear losing bullish bias and hence the downside move can’t be ignored. However, it all depends upon the RBA’s readiness to match the market forecasts of announcing no change to its currentmonetary policy. That said, the 0.6600 round figures can lure intraday sellers of the AUD/USD pair before the latest swing low near 0.6575. However, the yearly low marked in March, around 0.6565, as well as the 0.6530-25 support zone comprising tops marked in October-November 2022, will be important to watch afterward. Meanwhile, the support-turned-resistance line joins the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the pair’s March-April upside, close to 0.6655-60, to restrict the immediate upside of the AUD/USD pair.

"EUR/USD cheers US Dollar’s retreat to snap a three-day downtrend near 1.0990 during early Tuesday morning in Europe. In doing so, the Euro pair also benefits from the market’s anxiety ahead of the keyEurozoneinflation data amid the return of the bloc’s traders after a long weekend. It’s worth mentioning that the talks surrounding the US default and hawkish Fed bets, as well as about China growth and the Sino-American tension, seem to challenge the market’s previously US Dollar positive bias. The reason could be linked tothe European Central Bank (ECB)Officials’ readiness to keep the rate hike, as well as rejection of the recession woes even if the latestGross Domestic Product(GDP) for Eurozone and Germany appear softer. That said, US Treasury Department renewed fears of US default by pulling forward the date of running out of funds to match obligations if the current debt ceiling isn’t altered, to June 01 from previously signaled July. Following that, Reuters came out with the news suggesting the US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s push for an expedited process to consider a clean two-year suspension of the federal debt ceiling. Further, chatters of US President Joe Biden’s call to four top US diplomats and arranging a meeting on May 09 also made rounds. Elsewhere, a relief from the US First Republic Bank issue allowed traders to take a breather as the US regulators seized assets of the First Republic Bank and sold them to a new buyer, namely JP Morgan. On the other hand, the latest statements from China Beige Book (CBB) suggesting that new data offer the first evidence of a truly robust 2023 recovery in the dragon nation, per analysts from CBB, seem to favor the EUR/USD optimists. However, Axios came out with headlines suggesting the US allies’ preparations for the US-China war over Taiwan, which in turn keeps the Euro bears hopeful, via the US Dollar’s haven demand. It’s worth observing that Friday’s upbeat US inflation clues via Core PCE Price Index join Monday’s mostly firmer US PMI data to underpin hawkish bias about the Federal Reserve (Fed) and weigh on the sentiment. On the same line are the US inflation expectations, as per the 10-year and 5-year breakeven inflationratesfrom the St. Louis Federal Reserve (FRED) data. Against this backdrop, S&P 500 Futures print mild losses after retreating from a three-month high, down 0.10% intraday near 4,182 by the press time. On the same line, the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields retreat from a one-week high to 3.55% and 4.13% at the latest. Looking ahead, German Retail Sales for March and the ECB Bank Landing Survey may entertain EUR/USD pair traders ahead of the first readings of the Eurozone’s key inflation gauge for April, namely Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). Given the likely unchanged figures, any negative surprise won’t hesitate to recall the EUR/USD bears amid hawkish Fed bets. In that case, today’s US Factory Orders for March, expected to rise by 0.8% MoM versus -0.7% prior, can offer clear directions ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC and Thursday’s ECB monetary policy meetings. Technical analysis Despite the late rebound,EUR/USDkeeps the previous day’s downside break of an upward-sloping support line from late March, now immediate resistance near 1.1010, which in turn joins downbeat oscillators to favor Euro pair sellers.

Data also confirmed that the labour market remains very tight, with the unemployment rate at a near 50-year low. The path to achieving a soft landing remains a narrow one.

"UOB Group’s Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang noteEUR/USDis expected to navigate within the 1.0920-1.1040 range in the next few weeks. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “In NY trade, USD dropped sharply to a low of 1.0962. Downward momentum has improved, albeit not much. EUR is likely to edge lower from here but is unlikely to challenge the major support at 1.0915 (there is another support level at 1.0950). The downward pressure is intact as long as it stays below 1.1010 (minor resistance is at 1.0995).” Next 1-3 weeks: “Our latest narrative was from last Thursday (27 Apr, spot at 1.1045). We highlighted that ‘despite the relatively strong advance to 1.1095 on Wednesday, upward momentum has not improved much’. We added, ‘while EUR could ratchet higher towards 1.1120, the odds for a sustained rise above this major resistance level are not high for now’. Yesterday, EUR dropped to a low of 1.0962. While our ‘strong support’ at 1.0950 has not been breached, upward momentum has more or less faded. In other words, instead of advancing, EUR is more likely to trade in a range of 1.0920/1.1040 for now.”",0
"GBP/USD licks its wounds around 1.2500 after posting the biggest daily loss in a week, as well as snapping a three-day uptrend the previous day. In doing so, the Cable pair takes clues from the US Dollar’s retreat while cheering mostly upbeat inflation signals from the UK. However, comparatively more hawkish concerns surrounding the Fed, than the Bank of England (BoE), keep the Cable pair sellers hopeful as it lacks upside momentum near the highest levels in 11 months marked the previous day. Food prices at British supermarkets rose 15.7% in the year to April, the biggest annual increase in records going back to 2005, but lower prices are on the horizon, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said on Tuesday per Reuters. On the other hand, the USDollar Index(DXY) prints the first daily loss in four around 102.00 as US default fears loom after the Treasury Department bought forward the date of running out of funds to match obligations if the current debt ceiling isn’t altered, to June 01 from previously signaled July. It’s worth noting that a relief from the US First Republic Bank drama, after the US regulators seized assets of a troubled bank and sold them to a new buyer, namely JP Morgan, also weigh on the US Dollar and allow the GBP/USD buyers to return. It should be noted, however, that the recently upbeat US inflation clues and easing hopes of Fed policy pivot in 2023 seem to keep the US Dollar buyers hopeful. Furthermore, fears surrounding the US-China tension and comparatively stronger US jobs report add strength to the bearish bias about the Cable pair. Amid these plays, S&P 500 Futures track Wall Street’s indecisiveness near 4,180, retreating from a three-month high, whereas the US 10-year and two-year Treasury bond yields ease from a one-week high to 3.55% and 4.13% at the latest. Moving on,GBP/USD pairtraders should pay attention to the final readings of the UK S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for April, as well as the US Factory Orders for March, for intraday directions. However, major attention will be given to this week’s Federal Reserve (Fed)monetary policymeeting and the US jobs report for April. Technical analysis Although the 10-DMA level of around 1.2475 puts a floor under the GBP/USD prices for short-term the Cable pair’s rebound remains elusive unless crossing a one-month-old ascending resistance line, close to 1.2575 at the latest.

"EUR/USD has resumed its upside journey towards the psychological resistance of 1.1000 in the early European session. The major currency pair is showing resilience after recovery as the USDollar Index(DXY) has retreated from 102.10. The upside in the USD Index has remained capped around 102.20 for the past two weeks as investors are cautious amid uncertainty over the interest rate guidance by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to be delivered on Wednesday. S&P500 futures have recovered their entire losses generated in the Asian session, indicating a strong recovery in the risk appetite of the market participants. Investors are capitalizing on easing United States banking jitters and solid quarterly performance from technology stocks. On Monday, JP Morgan Chase announced the acquisition of First Republic Bank‘s assets after regulators seized the collapsed lender. Improvedmarket sentimenthas also supported the demand for US government bonds, which has trimmed the rally in US yields. The 10-year US Treasury yields have dropped below 3.56%.

Tuesday’s Eurozone preliminary Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) holds significant importance as it will be used by European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers while designing the monetary policy scheduled for Thursday. Fed’s interest rate guidance- a key trigger ahead To continue to maintain pressure on US Consumer Price Index (CPI), Federal Reserve chairJerome Powellis widely anticipated to raise interestratesby 25 basis points (bps) consecutively to 5.00-5.25%. Headline inflation in the US economy is continuously declining being supported by lower gasoline prices, however, core inflation has been critically persistent due to resilient consumer spending. While uncertainty over interest rate guidance is still stable as US economic conditions are changing now. For straight six months, US Manufacturing PMI is landing below the 50.0 threshold which is considered a situation of contraction USGross Domestic Product(GDP) slowed down to 1.1% in the first quarter from the consensus of 2.0% due to lower inventories. Firms have significantly winded up their inventories due to a bleakeconomic outlookamid higher interest rates. Apart from that, US labor market conditions are losing their resilience as firms are cutting jobs due to poor forward demand. To avoid recession, the Federal Reserve might pause paddling interest rates as it would infuse some confidence in investors and producers. Morgan Stanley has announced a planned lay-off of 3K more jobs as deals have slumped as reported by Bloomberg. Eurozone inflation to provide cues about ECB’s monetary policy action After observing a weak pace in Eurozone Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, which landed at 0.1% vs. the consensus of 0.2%, investors are shifting their focus toward inflation data. As per the consensus, the preliminary headline Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) (April) is seen unchanged at 6.9% and 0.9% on a quarterly and monthly basis. Also, annual core HICP is seen steady at 5.9% while monthly core HICP could land lower at 1.1% from the former release of 1.3%. Eurozone inflation is seen almost unchanged due to the extreme labor shortage, which has shifted the bargaining power for wages to job seekers from hiring agencies. There is no denying the fact that European Central Bank President ChristineLagardewill hike interest rates to improve its defense against stubborn inflation. The street is divided over the pace of the interest rate hike that the central bank will adopt. In March, the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points (bps).

"The GBP/USD pair turns lower for the second successive day on Tuesday and weakens further below the 1.2500 psychological mark during the first half of the European session. The US Dollar (USD) attracts some dip-buying and stands tall near a two-week high touched on Monday, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor exerting downward pressure on the GBP/USD pair. Expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will hike interestratesby 25 bps at the end of the two-day FOMC policy meeting on Wednesday led to the overnight rise in the US Treasury bond yields. Apart from this, a softer risk tone - amid looming recession risks - lends additional support to the safe-haven Greenback. The markets, meanwhile, seem convinced that the US central bank will signal a pause in its rate-hiking cycle. This might hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. Moreover, the Bank of England (BoE) is also expected to deliver a 25 bps lift-off in May, which might further contribute to limiting the downside for the GBP/USD pair. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before positioning for an extension of the recent pullback from the highest level since June 2022. On the economic data front, the UK ManufacturingPMIis revised higher and finalized at 47.8 for April as compared to the 46.6 estimated in the flash reading. This, however, does little to impress traders or provide any meaningful impetus to the GBP/USD pair. The US economic docket, meanwhile, features the release of JOLTS Job Openings data. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, will drive the USD demand and produce short-term trading opportunities around the major. The focus, however, will remain glued to the highly-anticipated FOMC policy decision, scheduled to be announced during the US session on Wednesday. The market attention will then shift to the closely-watched US monthly employment details, popularly known as theNFPreport.

"The AUD/USD pair retreats a few pips from over a one-week high touched earlier this Tuesday and trades just below the 0.6700 mark during the first half of the European session, still up over 1% for the day. The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthens across the board in reaction to the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) surprise 25 bps rate hike and hawkish outlook. In fact, the Australian central bank indicated that some further tightening of monetary policy may be required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe. This, in turn, prompts an aggressive short-covering rally around the AUD/USD pair, though the momentum loses steam near the 0.6715 area. The US Dollar (USD) reverses an intraday dip and holds steady near a two-week high set earlier this Tuesday amid expectations for additional 25 bps lift-off at the end of the two-day FOMC monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. The bets were reaffirmed by the US ISM PMI report released on Monday, which showed that business activity in the manufacturing sector pulled off a three-year low in April and that there was a build-up of inflation pressures last month. The prospects for further policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed), meanwhile, add to worries about economic headwinds stemming from rising borrowing costs. This, in turn, tempers investors' appetite for riskier assets, which is evident from a softer tone around the equity markets. The anti-risk flow further benefits the Greenback's relative safe-haven status and contributes to keeping a lid on any further gains for the AUD/USD pair, at least for the time being. The markets, however, now expect that the US central bank will signal a pause in its rate-hiking cycle beyond May. This might hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and continue to act as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair ahead of the highly-anticipated FOMC decision, scheduled to be announced on Wednesday. In the meantime, traders on Tuesday will take cues from the release of the US JOLTS Job Openings data, due later during the early North American session. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",1

"The PoundSterling (GBP) bleeds into the 1.24s against the US Dollar (USD) during the US session on Tuesday, as USD gains support from thenewsof the emergency rescue of First Republic Bank over the weekend. The takeover of the troubled lender by JP Morgan suggests the Federal Reserve is much more likely to hikeratesat its meeting concluding Wednesday. The release of lower-than-expected JOLTS Job Openings data triggers a sell-off in the US Dollar, however, providing a late lift to the pair during US hours. From a technical perspective, the GBP/USD pair continues to pull back from new year-to-date highs in the 1.2580s formed on April 28, and forms a two-bar reversal pattern that bodes follow-through lower in the very short-term, though the overarching trend remains bullish. GBP/USD market movers GBP/USD technical analysis: Correcting within an uptrend GBP/USD has been a broad sideways trend since the beginning of the year within a longer-term uptrend that began at the September 2022 lows. Despite the volatile ups and downs of recent months, the pair did manage to make new higher highs in the upper 1.25s in late April and the overall trend remains marginally bullish. Thus, Pound Sterling longs are marginally favored over shorts. GBP/USD: Daily Chart That said, a pullback may be unfolding at the moment after a two-bar bearish reversal pattern formed at the recent highs. Two-bar reversals are fairly reliable patterns which occur when a long green full-bodied candle that makes new highs as formed on April 28 is immediately reversed the following day by a long red-down candle of a similar length. They are bearish short-term signals. It is possible the two-bar pattern will now be followed by a leg lower which could see GBP/USD retest the 1.2350 April-range lows. Given the dominant trend remains bullish-to-sideways, however, pressure to the upside is likely to re-emerge, and could see the price recover and rally, before breaking to fresh highs. A decisive break above the year-to-date 1.2583 highs of April 28, would probably lead to a continuation higher to the next key resistance level at circa 1.2680. Decisive breaks are usually characterized by moves that begin with a strong green daily bar that breaks above the ceiling or resistance level, with price closing near the highs, or, alternatively by three green consecutive bars forming that break above the ceiling or resistance level. These provide added confirmation that the break is not a ‘false break’ or bull trap. Pound Sterling FAQs What is the Pound Sterling? The Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022data.Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, aka ‘Cable’, which < href=""https://fxssi.com/the-most-traded-currency-pairs"">accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the ‘Dragon’ as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE). How do the decisions of the Bank of England impact on the Pound Sterling? The single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of “price stability” – a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates.When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money.When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects. How does economic data influence the value of the Pound? Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP.A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall. How does the Trade Balance impact the Pound? Another significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period.If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance. ",1
"The USD/JPY pair pulls back from a nearly two-month high, around the 137.75-137.80 region touched earlier this Tuesday and remains on the defensive heading into the North American session. The pair is currently placed just below the mid-137.00s, down less than 0.10% for the day, and seems poised to prolong its recent appreciating move. A softer risk tone drives some haven flows towards the Japanese Yen (JPY) and is seen as a key factor exerting some downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair amid subdued US Dollar (USD) price action. In fact, the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, struggles to capitalize on its intraday uptick to a two-week high touched on Tuesday. A fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields, dragged down by expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will signal a pause in its policy-tightening cycle, acts as a headwind for the buck. The markets, however, have fully priced in another 25 bps rate hike at the end of the two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Moreover, the US ISM report released on Monday showed that there was a build-up of inflation pressures last month data kept alive the possibility of a further hike in June and continue to lend support to the Greenback. This marks a big divergence in comparison to the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) dovish stance, which supports prospects for the emergence of some dip-buying around the USD/JPY pair and should help limit the downside. Even from a technical perspective, the overnight sustained move and close above the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) add credence to the near-term positive outlook. Bullish traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive bets ahead of the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy decision on Wednesday. The focus will then shift to the release of the closely-watched US monthly employment details, popularly known as theNFPreport on Friday, which should help determine the near-term trajectory for the USD/JPY pair.

The Aussie lagged during the American session and AUD/NZD, which had surged to 1.0830, dropped back to 1.0735, the level it had before the RBA decision. Looking ahead, on Wednesday, Australia will report its March Retail Sales with a 0.2% expected gain, along with the AiG Manufacturing for March and the S&P Global Services PMI for April. Additionally, the New Zealand Q1 Employment report will be relevant. In the US, the focus will be on the Federal Reserve's decision. The ADP private payroll numbers and the S&P Global Services PMI are also due. Considering the relevance of theeconomic reportsahead, the FOMC decision, the RBA statement, and NFP, markets will likely remain busy, setting the stage for high volatility. AUD/USD short-term technical outlook The failure of AUD/USD to hold above 0.6700 suggests that the pair is not yet ready for a major rally. However, it did improve the outlook in the short term after breaking above the 0.6645/50 area, which has now become immediate support. Technical indicators are currently favoring a bullish outlook but without much conviction. If AUD/USD manages to reclaim 0.6700, it would strengthen the outlook for the bulls, opening the doors to 0.6750. On the daily chart, the situation is less favorable for the bulls as the price failed to hold above the 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 0.6680. The price is currently below key SMAs, and technical indicators are moving around midlines with a slightly upward slope.

In doing so, theAussiepair portrays the market’s cautious mood ahead of the top-tier data/events. Additionally, fears surrounding the banking fallouts and mixed US data also weigh on the Aussie pair prices. That said, fresh selling of PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp shares triggered banking fears across the board and put a floor under the US Dollar price, especially amid hawkishFedbets. However, mixed US data and softer US Treasury bond yields prod the greenback buyers ahead of the key US factors up for publishing. At its May monetary policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board members decided to lift the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.85%. In doing so, the Aussie central bank officials defied market expectations of keeping theratesunchanged. Not only does the RBA announce a 0.25% rate hike but the Aussie central bank also expects further tightening of the monetary policy. That said, the RBA also revised its inflation and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) forecasts in the latest policy document. Additionally, RBAGovernor Philip Lowerepeated that some further tightening may be required to bring inflation back to the 2-3% target within a reasonable timeframe. On the other hand, US Factory Orders for March improved to 0.9% versus 0.8% expected and -1.1% (revised) previous readings. Elsewhere, the US JOLTS Job Openings for the said month eased to 9.59M from 9.974M prior and 9.775M market forecasts.

However,the US Dollar Index(DXY) failed to cheer therisk aversionas the greenback’s gauge versus the six major currencies extend the previous day’s U-turn from a three-week high. Looking forward, AUD/USD pair traders may initially pay attention to Australia Retail Sales for March, expected to print stagnant growth of 0.2% MoM, before waiting for the US ADP Employment Change for April and the ISM Services PMI for the said month.

It’s worth noting that the MACD signals are bearish but the RSI (14) line is firmer, not overbought, which in turn suggests a gradual run-up in the EUR/USD prices. On the contrary, a downside break of the previous resistance line from April 26, now immediate support near 1.0990, could direct the Euro sellers towards the 21-DMA support of 1.0970.

"The AUD/USD pair has continued its sideways performance in a range of 0.6660-0.6670 despite the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported an upbeat Retail Sales data (March). Monthly Retail Sales have accelerated by 0.4%, higher than the consensus and the former release of 0.2%. Resilience in consumer spending indicates that the decision of hiking interest rates further by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was correct. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia hikes its Official Cash Rate (OCR) surprisingly by 25 basis points (bps) and pushed it to 3.85%. The street was anticipating a continuation of neutral policy by RBAGovernor Philip Loweas inflationary pressures are consistently declining for the past three months. However, the RBA believed that the current monetary policy is not restrictive enough to achieve the agenda of price stability. Going forward, investors will shift their focus on Australian Trade Balance (March) data, which will release on Thursday. Monthly Trade Balance data is seen declining 12,750M from the former release of 13,870M. A weaker-than-anticipated Trade Balance data would impact the Australian Dollar. Meanwhile, S&P500 futures are showing some gains in the Asian session, portraying a minor recovery in the risk appetite of the market participants.

"GBP/USD takes the bids to renew intraday high near 1.2490 as it cheers the broad US Dollar weakness ahead of the key Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting announcements. In doing so, the Cable pair buyers also cheer the latest doubts on the Fed’s capacity to further inflate the benchmark rates. On Tuesday, a top White House (WH) Economist Heather Boushey, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told Reuters that theFedis raising interestratesin the hope of reducing inflation. That is having this negative effect on the banking sector. “Why would we add to that?,” said WH Economist Heather Boushey. On the same line, mixed US data and looming fears of US default, as well as a divergence between the Bank of England (BoE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed), also propel the GBP/USD prices. That said,United StatesFactory Orders for March improved to 0.9% versus 0.8% expected and -1.1% (revised) previous readings. However, the US JOLTS Job Openings for the said month eased to 9.59M from 9.974M prior and 9.775M market forecasts. It’s worth noting that the easing of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) joined mixed ISM PMI details to prod the DXY bulls previously and favor the Cable pair buyers. However, upbeat inflation clues defend the Federal Reserve hawks, which in turn suggests the US central bank is all set for a 0.25% rate hike. As a result, traders are more interested in hearing about the Fed’s policy pivot, previously anticipated to take place in 2023, for clear GBP/USD guidance. Elsewhere, the Bank of England’s (BoE) more than 10% inflation contradicts the comparatively sluggish inflation data from the US, which in turn adds strength to the GBP/USD upside. Alternatively, fresh selling of PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp shares triggered banking fears across the board and prod the GBP/USD buyers. Additionally weighing on themarket sentimentand challenging the Cable pair bulls could be the US policymakers’ struggle to avoid debt ceiling expiration, looming in June versus previous expectations of July expiry. “Top US Senate Republicans on Tuesday called on President Joe Biden to accept their party's debt-ceiling package or make a counter-offer, while a top Democrat said the Senate might try to advance a ""clean"" debt-ceiling hike next week,” said Reuters. Against this backdrop, Wall Street closed in the red and the US Treasury bond yields also dropped whereas S&P 500 Futures also print mild losses at the latest.

Adding strength to the downside bias is the descending RSI (14) line that currently seesaws near the 50.0 level, which in turn suggests the continuation of the latest weakness in the USD/JPY price. However, the resistance-turned-support line from late March, around 135.70 at the latest, restricts the immediate downside of the USD/JPY pair. Following that, multiple levels marked since March 10 and 50-SMA highlight the 135.15-135.00 area as the key support to break for the Yen pair sellers before taking control. Even so, a one-month-old ascending support line near 133.80 can act as the last defense of the USD/JPY buyers. Meanwhile, USD/JPY pair’s recovery moves need to stabilize beyond the 137.00 immediate hurdle to convince intraday buyers.

"EUR/USDcheers broad US Dollar weakness as it prepares for the key Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting announcements early Wednesday, picking up bids to refresh intraday high near 1.1025 by the press time. The Euro pair extends the previous recovery from a short-term support line despite mixed Eurozone inflation data and European Central Bank (ECB) updates. The reason could be linked to unimpressive US statistics and doubts that the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) rate hikes are responsible for the latest banking turmoil. In its latest Bank Lending Survey (BLS),the European Central Bank (ECB)noted that a net 38% ofEurozonebanks reported a fall in demand for credit from companies in the first quarter of the year, which in turn suggests a negative impact of the rate hikes on the bloc’s credit conditions.

That is having this negative effect on the banking sector. “Why would we add to that?,” said WH Economist Heather Boushey. Talking about the data, the first readings of Eurozone inflation, per the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), rose to 7.0% YoY in April versus 6.9% market forecasts and previous readings. However, the ECB’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the Core HICP, eased to 5.6% during the stated period versus 5.7% analysts’ estimations and previous readings.

With this, the S&P 500 Futures pare recent losses around 4,142, mildly bid of late. Looking forward, EUR/USD pair traders should pay attention to the risk catalysts and the US ADP Employment Change for April, as well as the ISM Services PMI for the said month, for clear directions. Above all, the Fed’s monetary policy announcements should be watched carefully as the US central bank’s 0.25% rate hike is already given and the talks of policy pivot are on the table, which in turn can propel the Euro prices in case proven right.

GBP weakened more than expected as it broke slightly below 1.2440 (low of 1.2436) before rebounding.

In NY trade, GBP dropped to 1.2436 before rebounding. The breach of the ‘strong support’ level at 1.2440 indicates that GBP is unlikely to strengthen further.

"GBP/USD portrays pre-Fed consolidation near 1.2490 as it retreats from its intraday high heading into Wednesday’s London open. Even so, the Cable pair remains firmer for the first day in three. That said, the quote’s latest pullback could be linked to the bearish MACD signals, apart from the cautious mood ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting announcements. Also read:GBP/USD nears 1.2500 as doubts over Fed's role in banking turmoil weigh on US Dollar However, the GBP/USD pair’s sustained trading beyond the 100-SMA and an ascending support line from April 21, respectively near 1.2460 and 1.2440, keeps the buyers hopeful. Even if the Cable pair breaks the 1.2440 trend line support, the 200-SMA level of around the 1.2400 threshold can prod the GBP/USD bears.

"The USD/JPY pair extends the previous day's sharp retracement slide from the 137.75-137.80 region, or a nearly two-month high and remains under heavy selling pressure for the second successive day on Wednesday. The downfall remains uninterrupted through the early European session and drags spot prices below the 136.00 mark, or a fresh weekly low in the last hour. Concerns that several other regional US lenders were facing solvency issues fuel worries about a full-blown banking crisis and boost demand for traditional safe-haven assets, including the Japanese Yen (JPY), This, in turn, drags the USD/JPY pair lower amid the ongoing US Dollar (USD) retracement slide from a three-week top touched on Tuesday. The overnight release of the US Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) indicated that the ultra-tight US job market is loosening. Apart from this, concerns over the US debt ceiling and renewed fears of a full-blown banking crisis continue to weigh on the Greenback. That said, a big divergence in the monetary policy stance adopted by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) could help limit the downside for the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. It is worth recalling that BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said last week that the risk from tightening too hastily is larger than monetary policy falling behind the curve and added that it will be appropriate to continue monetary easing to achieve the 2% inflation target.  In contrast, the US central bank is widely expected to hike interestratesby another 25 bps at the end of a two-day monetary policy meeting later this Wednesday. Market participants, however, remain divided over the possibility that theFedwill announce a pause in its rate-hiking cycle as inflation is still trending well above the central bank's target range. That said, the risk of a banking crisis and worsening economic conditions might force the US central bank to soften its hawkish tone. The uncertainty, meanwhile, might hold back traders from placing aggressive bets around the USD/JPY pair ahead of the highly-anticipated FOMC decision, due to be announced later during the US session. This, in turn, warrants caution before positioning for any meaningful corrective fall. Heading into the key event risk, traders on Wednesday might take cues from theUS economic docket, featuring the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment and the ISM Services PMI.

"Today's main event is the FOMC meeting. Economists at Commerzbank analyze how the US Dollar andthe EUR/USD paircould react to the Fed policy announcement. Market sees no chance of a further rate hike “The market expects the Fed to hikeratesby 25 bps resulting in a key rate corridor of 5.0%-5.25%. This step has been fully priced in by the market and will therefore not cause much of a reaction in the Dollar.” “Following today’s step, the market sees no chance of a further rate hike. A moderately hawkish statement that refers to continued high inflation levels and does not exclude further tightening would make rate cuts this year seem less likely, meaning the market would have to adjust its expectations. This is likely to support the Dollar against the Euro, as it would tarnish the market’s conviction that the ECB is acting in a much more decisive manner than the Fed.” “As we consider it to be unlikely that the Fed will signal a rate pause at this stage, the risks inEUR/USDas a result of today’s Fed meeting are therefore rather pointing to the downside.” ",0
"GBP/USD hovers around the key 1.2500 level. Economists at ING expect the pair to remain stable. EUR/GBP downside risks this week “Today, the Fed may not have a sizeable impact on Cable in our view, and leave it close to the 1.2500 mark. We don’t see a high chance of last week’s highs (1.2580) being tested again very soon.” “When it comes toEUR/GBP, we are seeing some rebound in the run-up to theECBmeeting. We suspect that the ECB announcement may fall short of the market’s hawkish pricing and therefore see some downside risks for the pair laterthis week(i.e. a return to 0.8750/0.8780 area).” ",1
"AUD/USDis expected to advance beyond 0.6700 while above the 0.6610 region, according to Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “The strong surge in AUD that sent it to a high of 0.6717 came as a surprise (we were expecting AUD to consolidate). The sharp and rapid pullback from the high in overbought conditions suggests the advance is overdone. In other words, AUD is unlikely to advance further. Today, AUD is more likely to trade sideways, expected to be between 0.6630 and 0.6705.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Last Wednesday (26 Apr, spot at 0.6635), we indicated that ‘downward momentum is beginning to build’ and we were of the view that AUD ‘is likely to edge lower but any decline is likely to face solid support at the year-to-date low near 0.6565’. After AUD dropped briefly to 0.6575 last Friday and rebounded, we highlighted yesterday (02 May, spot at 0.6630) that ‘while downward momentum has waned, there is still a slim chance for AUD to test the 0.6565 level’. We did not anticipate the surge in AUD that sent it to a high of 0.6717. Downward momentum has faded and upward momentum is beginning to build, albeit tentatively. From here, as long as AUD holds above 0.6610 (current level of ‘strong support’), it could edge higher to 0.6740. At this stage, the odds of a sustained rise above 0.6740 are not high.”",1
"The AUD/USD pair struggles to gain any meaningful traction on Wednesday and seesaws between tepid gains/minor losses, just above mid-0.6600s through the early part of the European session. The Australian Dollar (AUD) continues to draw some support from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) surprise 25 bps rate hike on Tuesday and a more hawkish outlook. This, along with the ongoing US Dollar (USD) retracement slide from a three-week high touched the previous day, acts as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair. The overnight release of the US Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) indicated that the ultra-tight US job market is loosening. Apart from this, concerns over the US debt ceiling and renewed fears of a full-blown banking crisis drag the Greenback lower for the second straight day. Apart from this, a modest recovery in the US equity futures undermines the safe-haven buck and benefits the risk-sensitiveAussie. The upside for the AUD/USD pair, however, remains capped as traders seem reluctant to place aggressive bets ahead of the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy decision, due to be announced later during the US session. The Federal Reserve (Fed) is widely expected to hikeratesby 25 bps, though investors seem divided over the possibility that the Fed will announce a pause in its rate-hiking cycle as inflation is still trending well above the central bank's target range. Hence, the focus will be on the accompanying monetary policy statement andFedChair Jerome Powell's comments at the post-meeting press conference, which will be scrutinized for clues about the future rate-hike path. This, in turn, will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and provide some meaningful impetus to the AUD/USD pair. Heading into the key central bank event risk, traders on Wednesday might take cues from theUS economic docket- featuring the release of the ADP report on private-sector employment and the ISM Services PMI - to grab short-term opportunities.

"Considering the recent price action,USD/JPYcould still challenge the 137.90 region in the short-term horizon, comment Economist Lee Sue Ann and Markets Strategist Quek Ser Leang at UOB Group. Key Quotes 24-hour view: “We expected USD to advance further yesterday but we noted that ‘deeply overbought conditions suggest a sustained rise above 137.90 is unlikely’. However, USD did not quite challenge 137.90 as it staged a surprisingly sharp pullback from 137.77 (low has been 136.30). Upward momentum has faded and USD has likely moved into a consolidation and it is likely to trade between 135.50 and 137.70 today.” Next 1-3 weeks: “Yesterday (02 May, spot at 137.40), we held the view that USD is likely to strengthen further and the focus is at Mar high near 137.90. We did not quite expect the volatile price actions as USD rose to 137.77 in Asian trade and then plummeted to 136.30 in NY trade. While there is still room for USD to rise above 137.90, overbought conditions could lead to a couple of days of consolidation phase. In view of the increase involatility, we are adjusting our ‘strong support’ level to 135.20 from 136.00. A break of the ‘strong support’ level could indicate that 137.90 is not coming into view for now.”",1
"EUR/USDupward momentum has deteriorated after approaching the previous multi-year trend line near 1.1070. Economists at Société Générale discuss the pair’s outlook. Defending 1.0730 is crucial for continuation in up move “A phase of consolidation is underway; failure to reclaim the 1.1070 hurdle can take the pair gradually lower towards an ascending trend line since September at 1.0790/1.0730; this is a crucial support zone.” “Daily MACD has turned flattish denoting lack of clear direction. If the pair fails to hold above 1.0730, there would be risk of a deeper downtrend.” ",0
"The single currency extends the bid bias and liftsEUR/USDto fresh weekly highs in the 1.1045/50 band on Wednesday. EUR/USD looks strong ahead of Fed EUR/USD advances for the second session in a row and looks to consolidate the recent breakout of the psychological 1.1000 hurdle on the back of further weakness surrounding the greenback ahead of the FOMC gathering due later in the NA session. On this key event, investors already priced in a 25 bps rate hike, although the subsequent press conference by Chair J. Powell will be in the centre of the debate following the Committee’sinterest rate decision. Moving forward, the pair is seen facing increasingvolatilityin light of the key ECB meeting on Thursday, where the central bank is also seen raising the policy rate by 25 bps, although there is a small possibility of a larger hike (50 bps?). In the domestic calendar, the Unemployment Rate in the broader Euroland ticked lower to 6.5% in March. Across the ocean, the ADP report and weekly Mortgage Applications will also be in the limelight. What to look for around EUR EUR/USD’s upside momentum keeps gathering pace and now shifts the attention to the 2023 high near 1.1100 the figure amidst persistent dollar weakness. Meanwhile, price action around the single currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the Fed-ECB divergence when it comes to the banks’ intentions regarding the potential next moves in interest rates.

Next hurdle at 1.2610/1.2670 “Cable is gradually inching towards the down sloping trend line drawn since 2021 near 1.2610/1.2670. This could be an interim resistance zone. If the up move falters near this hurdle, a short-term pullback is likely.” “The 50-Day Moving Average at 1.2270 is a crucial support. Break could result in a deeper down move.” ",1
Economists at ING assess the impact on theEUR/USDpair of the combination of both theFed(Wednesday) and the ECB (Thursday) policy announcements. Moderate downside risks for EUR/USD “We see room for EUR/USD to pull back to the 1.0900 mark as a result of the combined effect of the FOMC and the ECB impact.” “The stretched positioning and very hawkish expectations on ECB tightening suggest the balance of risks for the euro ahead of theECBis slightly tilted to the downside.”,0
"The GBP/USD pair regains positive traction on Wednesday and snaps a two-day losing streak to a nearly one-week low, around the 1.2435 region touched the previous day. The pair maintains its bid tone through the first half of the European session and is currently placed near the top end of its daily range, just above the 1.2500 psychological mark. The US Dollar (USD) drifts lower for the second successive day and retreats further from a three-week high touched on Tuesday, which, in turn, is seen as a key factor pushing the GBP/USD pair higher. The overnight release of the US Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) indicated that the ultra-tight US job market is loosening. Apart from this, concerns over the US debt ceiling, along with renewed fears of a full-blown banking crisis, drag the US Treasury bond yields lower and continue to weigh on the Greenback. Apart from this, a modest recovery in the US equity futures undermines the safe-haven buck and lends additional support to the GBP/USD pair, though the upside seems limited ahead of the highly-anticipated FOMC monetary policy decision. The Federal Reserve (Fed) is widely expected to hikeratesby 25 bps and could soften its hawkish stance amid slowing economic growth. Investors, however, remain divided over the possibility that theFedwill announce a pause in its rate-hiking cycle as inflation is still trending well above the target.

A short-term dip is expected towards 135.20/134.60 “USD/JPY is now challenging the 200-DMA and close to graphical resistance of 138 representing December/March peaks. This hurdle must be overcome to affirm a larger bounce.” “A short-term pullback is not ruled out, however, 135.20/134.60, the 38.2% retracement of last bout of up move should provide support.” “If the pair establishes above 138, the phase of rebound could extend towards projections of 139.60/140.30.” ",1
"The PoundSterling (GBP) recovers year-to-date highs just short of 1.2600 against the US Dollar (USD) after hawkish comments from the President ofthe European Central Bank (ECB)Christine Lagarde on Thursday. After an initially bearish reaction to the ECB policy announcement the Euro – and Pound Sterling – recovered versus the US Dollar after Lagarde underscored the inflationary headwinds in the euro area during her press conference and the ECB's determination not stop tightening monetary policy to fend off future price rises. Friday'sNonfarm Payrolls(NFP) jobs report, could further injectvolatilityinto GBP/USD if it misses expectations (bearish for USD, bullish for GBP/USD) or comes out substantially higher (bullish for USD, bearish for GBP/USD). From a technical perspective, GBP/USD continues to edge higher within a range, which is part of a broader bullish trend that began at the September 2022 lows. Longs are, therefore, favored over shorts. GBP/USD market movers GBP/USD technical analysis: Sideways in an uptrend GBP/USD trades back at its highs in the upper 1.25s after the ECB meeting and press conference on Thursday. Nevertheless, the overall trend is bullish, thus, Pound Sterling longs are generally favored over shorts. GBP/USD: Daily Chart Given the dominant trend remains bullish price will probably continue breaking to fresh highs. A decisive break and close above the 1.2590 highs set on May 3, would likely lead to a continuation higher to the next key resistance level at circa 1.2680. Decisive breaks are usually characterized by moves that begin with a strong green daily bar that breaks above the ceiling level or key high, with price closing near the highs of the day. Alternatively, three consecutive green bars above the ceiling level can also confirm breakouts. Such insignia provide confirmation that the break is not a ‘false break’ or bull trap. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a bearish divergence with price although it is not acute enough to draw any conclusions. The RSI at the April 28 peak of 1.2583 was higher than it was at the 1.2590 May 3 peak, suggesting the most recent acsent lacked momentum. This is indicative of mild underlying weakness. European Central Bank FAQs What is the ECB and how does it influence the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region.The ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa.The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it affect the Euro? In extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets – usually government or corporate bonds – from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro.QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic. What is Quantitative tightening (QT) and how does it affect the Euro? Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro. ",1

Notably, according to the futures market, this is the last increase expected by investors, as they are already pricing in 75 bps of rate cuts by year’s end. On the Europan Central Bank front, estimates are lingering between a 50 or 25 bps increase. Although a 25 bps rate hike is already priced in, going twice is likely possible after the latest EU inflation data report.

The FOMC also removed forward guidance about further rate hikes but noted that the timing of future rate changes would depend on incoming economic data. The bias still favors further tightening. The currency market saw limited impact. Analysts at Societe Generale explained: With the Fed funds target range of 5.00-5.25% the Fed has met its dot-plot guidance from last December and updated as of March. A pause is the next step. A full stop requires confirmation that inflation pressures (rents in particular) subside and employment slows. Wall Street stocks closed lower, and US bond yields declined further, putting pressure on the US Dollar. TheUS Dollar Index (DXY)closed at its lowest level in a week, around 101.35 but remained above recent lows. Meanwhile, the US 10-year yield settled at 3.36%, marking a one-month low.

"AUD/USD pauses its recent upward trajectory, especially backed by theFedvs. RBA play, as it takes offers to 0.6660 during early Thursday morning in Asia. The Aussie pair recently benefited from the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) hesitance in suggesting further rate hikes, despite announcing a 25 basis points (bps) increase to the benchmark Fed rate. Also favoring the quote could be the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) hawkish surprise and upbeat Aussie Retail Sales marked previously. However, US banking fallout fears and US debt ceiling expiration woes seem to underpin the latest decline in the AUD/USD prices. Fresh selling of PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp shares triggered banking fears across the board, which in turn exerts downside pressure on the AUD/USD prices. On the same line could be the comments from the White House suggesting debt limit default could cost 8.3 million job losses. Further, Reuters said that shares of US regional lenders collapsed in extended trade on Wednesday, with PacWest Bancorp losing over half its value after reports the California bank is exploring strategic options, including a sale. On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark rate to the highest levels since 2007 by announcing a 0.25% increase, matching market forecasts. The policymakers including Chairman Jerome appeared positive while ruling out fears of banking rout. However, a dropping in the guidance signaling further rate hike gained major attention and weighed on the US Dollar despite the hawkish move. On the other hand, Australia’s seasonally adjusted Retail Sales for March rose 0.4% versus market expectations of witnessing a 0.2% steady growth number. Further, Australia’s AiG Industry Index for March rose to 20.1 versus -6.1 prior whereas the AiG Manufacturing and Construction PMIs for the said month dropped to -20.2 and -12.4 respective levels versus -5.8 and 5.6 priors in that order. Further, S&P Global Services PMI for April improved to 53.7 versus 52.6 initial forecasts while the Composite PMI also rose to 53.0 from 52.2 first estimations for the said month. Talking about the US data, US ADP Employment Change rose to 296K for April from 142K prior versus 148K market forecast. Additionally, the annual pay growth declined to 13.2% from 14.2%. Further, ISM Services PMI improved to 51.9 in April versus 51.8 market forecasts and 51.2 previous readings. It’s worth noting, however, that the S&P Global Services PMI and Composite PMI for April eased to 53.6 and 53.4 versus 53.7 and 53.5 respective priors. Further, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) surprises markets by lifting the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.85%. Not only does the RBA announce a 0.25% rate hike but theAussiecentral bank also expects further tightening of the monetary policy. Moving on, Australia’s Trade Balance for March and China’s CaixinManufacturing PMIfor April can offer immediate directions. However, major attention will be given to the risk catalysts for clear directions. Technical analysis Despite a four-day uptrend, AUD/USD repeatedly fails to provide a daily closing beyond the 21-DMA and a three-week-old descending resistance line, respectively near 0.6675 and 0.6685, which in turn teases sellers.

Meanwhile, upbeat US labor market conditions are signaling that a hawkish stance from the Fed would not be over soon as labor shortage could propel inflationary pressures. On Wednesday, the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) agency reported an addition of fresh 296K jobs in April vs. the estimates of 150K and the former release of 145K. There is no denying the fact that extreme labor shortage would have been offset by offering higher wages, which carries the potential of making inflation persistent.

Also read:European Central Bank Preview: Lagarde set to lift the Euro in two out of three scenarios It’s worth noting that the RSI (14) line is in a descending formation since April 14 even if the Euro pair grinds higher, which in turn suggests that the bulls are running out of steam. The same joins the quote’s nearness to the aforementioned trend channel’s resistance line, close to 1.1110, to increase the odds of the EUR/USD pair’s pullback. In that case, a convergence of the 100-SMA and one-week-old previous resistance line, near 1.0995, could lure the intraday sellers ahead of the stated channel’s bottom line, close to 1.0950 at the latest. Even so, theEUR/USDbears need to remain cautious ahead of the 200-SMA break, currently around 1.0925.

"GBP/USD bulls take a breather around 1.2580, after rising to the highest levels since June 2021 early Thursday. That said, the Cable pair initially cheered the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) dovish hike before retreating from an upward-sloping resistance line from April 14. Given the quote’s pullback from the short-term key resistance line joining the overbought RSI (14) and easing the bullish bias of the MACD, the GBP/USD price may witness further pullback. However, an ascending trend line from Tuesday, near 1.2525 by the press time, restricts the immediate downside ofthe PoundSterling. Following that, the GBP/USD bears may prod the 200-Hour Moving Average (HMA) support of near 1.2485. In a case where the Cable pair remains bearish past 200-HMA, the weekly low of 1.2435 can act as the last defense of the buyers.

Even so, the 1.2600 round figure and the May 2022 peak of around 1.2665 can challenge the GBP/USD bulls before directing them to the 1.2700 round figure.

It’s worth noting that the Yen pair’s repeated failures to provide a daily closing beyond 138.00 join the pair’s pullback moves that broke the previous support zone around 135.25-15, comprising levels marked since mid-February, to keep the USD/JPY bears hopeful. On the same line, the looming bear cross on the MACD adds strength to the downside bias. However, the 21-day EMA and a five-week-old ascending support line prod the Yen pair sellers near 134.50-40 support confluence. Following that, a convergence of the 50-day EMA and 200-day EMA, near 133.85, will be key to watch for the USD/JPY pair as it holds the gate for the bear’s welcome.

However, the cautious mood and banking crisis prods the bulls ahead of the all-important European Central Bank (ECB) Monetary Policy Decision. On Wednesday, the Fed fails to convince the US Dollar buyers despite increasing the benchmarkratesto the highest levels since 2007 as the Monetary Policy Statement opens the door for speculations surrounding a pause in the Fed’s policy tightening. That said, FedChairman Jerome Powellalso appeared positive while ruling out fears of a banking rout. However, a dropping of the lines in the statement suggesting the need for further rate hikes gained major attention and weighed on the US Dollar despite the hawkish move by the Fed. In addition to the Fed’s 25 basis points (bps) rate hike, upbeat US data should have also challenged the EUR/USD bulls but did not amid the looming bank crisis in the US and fears of debt ceiling expiration.

On the other hand, PacWest Bancorp teased an asset sale late Wednesday and propelled the market’s banking woes. Further, the White House statements suggesting debt limit default could cost 8.3 million job losses also weigh on the sentiment and the US Dollar.

Looking forward, EUR/USD traders will pay attention to theECBMonetary Policy Announcements as some on the floor do expect a 50 bps rate hike, versus a large majority suggesting 0.25% increase in the benchmark rates.

"The GBP/USD pair struggles to capitalize on its modest intraday uptick and retreats from the vicinity of the 1.2600 mark, or its highest level since June 2022 touched this Thursday. Spot prices drop back closer to the daily low during the early European session and currently trade just above mid-1.2500s, nearly unchanged for the day. The US Dollar (USD) recovers a part of its intraday losses to over a one-week low and turns out to be a key factor that acts as a headwind for the GBP/USD pair. Looming recession risks continue to weigh on investors' sentiment, which is evident from the prevalent cautious mood around the equity markets and lends some support to the safe-haven buck. That said, any meaningful USD recovery seems elusive amid a further decline in the US Treasury bond yields and the Federal Reserve's (Fed) less hawkish outlook. It is worth recalling that the US central bank, as was widely anticipated, raised interestratesby 25 bps and opened the door for a possible pause in June at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. In the post-meeting presser, Powell signalled that the Fed was close to hitting the terminal rate of the current hiking cycle. This, along with concerns over the US debt ceiling and renewed fears of a full-blown banking crisis, continues to drag the US bond yields lower and should keep a lid on the attempted USD bounce. Apart from this, rising bets for another 25 bps rate hike by the Bank of England (BoE) might continue to underpin the British Pound and contribute to limiting the downside for the GBP/USD pair. Traders, however, might refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and prefer to move to the sidelines ahead of the closely-watched US monthly employment details, popularly known as theNFPreport on Friday. This will influence the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to the pair. In the meantime, traders on Thursday will take cues from the Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data from the US, due later during the early North American session. Apart from this, the broader risk sentiment and the US bond yields will drive the USD demand. This, along with the post-European Central Bank (ECB) decisionvolatilityin the markets, should allow traders to grab short-term opportunities around the GBP/USD pair.",1

On this, the central bank is seen hiking the policy rate by 25 bps, although a larger rate raise (50 bps?) is not completely off the table, as per hawkish messages from rate setters and the persistently elevated inflation.

In the euro calendar, final Services PMIs in Germany and the euro area came at 56.0 and 56.2, respectively, for the month of April.

What to look for around EUR EUR/USD’s upside momentum keeps gathering pace and now shifts the attention to the 2023 high near 1.1100 the figure amidst persistent dollar weakness and prudence ahead of the ECB meeting. Meanwhile, price action around the single currency should continue to closely follow dollar dynamics, as well as the Fed-ECB divergence when it comes to the banks’ intentions regarding the potential next moves in interestrates.

"GBP/USD is trading closer to 1.26. Economists at ING believe that the pair could inch higher to 1.2650/2750. EUR/GBP to remain steady near 0.800 “It seems that the view that European banks, including the UK, are better regulated than those in the US is providing some insulation to European currencies. This is also helping to keep expectations alive (expectations with which we disagree) that the Bank of England can hikeratestwo to three more times this year. Our latest views are that the BoE may not push back against these expectations next week – which would see Sterling hang onto recent gains.” “ExpectEUR/GBPto remain steady (slight upside bias) near 0.8800, while GBP/USD could trade up to 1.2650/2750 – shouldEUR/USDmanage to break through 1.1100 with momentum.”",1
"The USD/JPY pair attracts some buying near the 134.15 area, or the weekly low touched this Thursday and climbs to the top end of its daily range during the early European session. The pair is currently placed around the 134.65-134.70 region and for now, seems to have stalled its retracement slide from a nearly two-month high touched on Tuesday. The US Dollar (USD) stages a modest recovery from over a one-week low and turns out to be a key factor lending some support to the USD/JPY pair. The modest USD bounce, meanwhile, lacks any obvious fundamental catalyst and is more likely to remain capped amid the Federal Reserve's (Fed) less hawkish outlook. In fact, the US central bank, as was widely anticipated, raised interestratesby 25 bps and opened the door for a possible pause in June. In the post-meeting presser, Powell signalled that theFedwas close to hitting the terminal rate of the current hiking cycle, though did not explicitly confirm a pause. Powell also warned that US economic growth was cooling and noted that credit conditions were likely to tighten further in the wake of growing pressure on banks. This, along with concerns over the US debt ceiling, drags the US Treasury bond yields lower and acts as a headwind for the USD. Apart from this, looming recession risks continue to weigh on investors' sentiment, which could benefit the JPY's relative safe-haven status and contribute to capping the USD/JPY pair, at least for the time being. The downside, meanwhile, remains cushioned amid a more dovish stance adopted by theBoJ, leaving its ultra-loose monetary policy settings unchanged and making no tweaks to its yield curve control (YCC) by a unanimous vote last week. The aforementioned mixed fundamental backdrop makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before confirming that the USD/JPY pair has formed a near-term bottom and positioning for any meaningful appreciating move. Traders might also refrain from placing aggressive directional bets and prefer to wait on the sidelines ahead of the release of the closely-watched US monthly jobs data, popularly known as theNFPreport on Friday. In the meantime, the US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data might provide some impetus later during the early North North American session on Thursday. This, along with the US bond yields, could influence the USD price dynamics. Apart from this, the post-European Central Bank (ECB)volatilityin the markets will drive demand for the safe-haven JPY and contribute to producing short-term trading opportunities around the USD/JPY pair.

"Economists at Danske Bank make no changes to their Fed call, see no rate cuts this year and expectEUR/USDto fall to 1.06 in six months. A hawkish 50 bps hike from the ECB could still drive EUR/USD higher in the near-term “For now, we stick to our view that the Fed will maintain rates unchanged for the remainder of the year.” “With markets pricing around 72 bps worth of cuts for the rest of the year, if we are right in our call, relativeratesshould add broad support to the USD in H2. Combined with relative terms of trade, growth differentials and relative unit labour cost, we expect EUR/USD to head lower towards 1.06 in 6M. That said, a hawkish 50 bps hike from theECBtoday could still drive the cross higher in the near-term.” ",0
"The AUD/USD pair struggles to capitalize on its modest intraday uptick and attracts some selling near the 0.6700 round-figure mark on Thursday. Spot prices, however, manage to hold above the daily low through the first half of the European session and currently trade with a mild negative bias, just above mid-0.6600s. As investors look past the better-than-expected release of the Australian trade balance data, a modest US Dollar (USD) bounces from over a one-week low turns out to be a key factor exerting some downward pressure on the AUD/USD pair. Looming recession risks continue to weigh on investors' sentiment, which is evident from the prevalent cautious mood around the equity markets and lends some support to the safe-haven buck. That said, any meaningful USD recovery seems elusive in the wake of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) less hawkish outlook. It is worth recalling that the US central bank, as was widely expected, raised interestratesby 25 bps and opened the door for a possible pause in June at the end of a two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. In the post-meeting presser, Powell signalled that theFedwas close to hitting the terminal rate of the current hiking cycle. This, along with concerns over the US debt ceiling and renewed fears of a full-blown banking crisis, keeps the US Treasury bond yields depressed and might hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets. The Australian Dollar (AUD), on the other hand, might continue to draw support from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) surprise 25-basis-points interest-rate hike earlierthis week. Moreover, the Australian central bank indicated that some further tightening of monetary policy may be required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe. This, in turn, should act as a tailwind for the AUD/USD pair and limit the downside, making it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before positioning for any further depreciating move. Market participants now look to the release of the usual Weekly Initial Jobless Claims data from the US, due later during the early North American session. This, along with the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment, will influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the AUD/USD pair. The focus, however, will remain glued to the closely-watched US monthly employment details, popularly known as theNFPreport on Friday. This will drive the USD demand and determine the near-term trajectory for the major. Technical levels to watch AUD/USD  ",1
"Economists at Société Générale discuss the European Central Bbank (ECB)interest rate decisionand its implications forthe EUR/USD pair. Hawkish 25 bps or dovish 50 bps? “Our house call was for the ECB to hike by 50 bps, but the combo of below-forecast 1Q GDP growth (0.1% QoQ), a decline in core inflation to 5.6% in April (services up 0.1pp), tightening in ECB bank lending conditions and lower demand for loans tilted the scales in favour of a (hawkish) 25 bps.” “Guidance in the statement and by PresidentLagardethat the tightening cycle is not over in theory should be conducive to the EUR/USD overcoming the April high of 1.1095 and having a go at 1.11 when the large option expiry rolls off and delta hedging flows subside.” “Upside for rates could be limited if investors opt for the safety of govies and receiving in swaps in the face of banking and debt ceiling jitters in the US.” ",1
"EUR/USDremains close to the highs of the year. Economists at ING analyze the pair’s outlook ahead ofthe European Central Bank (ECB)meeting. Positioning is probably the biggest headwind to EUR/USD “Today should see a 25 bps ECB hike and it is now probably stretched positioning which is the biggest headwind to further EUR/USD gains.” “There is a risk that the hawkish ECB sends EUR/USD through 1.1100 today, but a) long positioning is quite stretched and b) a hawkish ECB is priced. This warns that EUR/USD could hang around this 1.10 area a little longer – particularly were the US equity sell-off to gain momentum.”",0
"Economists at TD Securities are biased to furtherEUR/USDupside. Lurch higher may be dependent on the interplay between the ECB and NFP “A lurch higher inthe EUR/USD pairmay be dependent on the interplay between the ECB and USNFP. All told, we think the ECB has some leeway to credibly sound more hawkish, which means there may be more fluidity around the terminal rate.” “1.1120/1.1200 is the key resistance area, and we think it is likely we test this near-term.” ",1
"Kit Juckes, Chief Global FX Strategist at Société Générale, expectsthe EUR/USD pairto advance nicely. EUR/USD will fall a bit on a knee-jerk reaction to 25 bps move “EUR/USD will fall a bit on a knee-jerk reaction to 25 bps move today but it’s basically a coin-toss between a ’hawkish 25’ and a ‘dovish 50’.” “It’s what the market thinks happens next that really matters. And that depends on the data. So far, we’ve seen some softness in recent European figures (PMI revisions and German trade, today) and that’s stalling Euro gains.” “We don’t think theEurozonehas the same issues as the US and data should reflect that in the coming weeks, draggingEUR/USDslowly higher.” ",1
EUR/USDis capped near 1.11 again ahead of the ECB policy decision. Economists at Scotiabank explain what is needed to lift the pair through 1.11. Support aligns at 1.1000/10 “A clear message from PresidentLagardethat more hikes are coming should underpin the EUR but a strongly hawkish message might be needed to push EUR/USD through 1.11 and on to the 1.12 area at the moment.” “Support is 1.1000/10 ahead of 1.0940/50.” See:There is a risk that the hawkish ECB sends EUR/USD through 1.1100 – ING ,1
"EUR/USD’s rally is clearly slowing but economists at Credit Suisse still see scope for one final leg higher to the 1.1185/1.1275 zone. Move below support at 1.0963 to mark a near-term top “EUR/USD uptrend is clearly slowing with strength again essentially capped at the shallow uptrend channel from the beginning of January. We would still though not rule out one final leg higher to our 1.1185/1.1275 core target – the 61.8% retracement and March 2022 high. Our bias would then be to look for an important top here.” “Below support at 1.0963 is now needed to mark a near-term top for a test of the April low and 55-DMA at 1.0806/1.0788, which ideally holds on a closing basis. Below though would warn of a potentially more important downturn and a test of support at 1.0540/1.0483.” ",1

"EUR/USDaccelerates the corrective decline and probed the boundaries of the key 1.1000 level on Thursday, where solid contention appears to have emerged. EUR/USD: Gains remain capped by 1.1100 so far EUR/USD comes under pressure and faces some increasedvolatilityas President Lagarde’s press conference is under way on Thursday. So far, the pair probed once again the boundaries of the 1.1100 barrier just to give away all those gains and poke with the 1.1000 neighbourhood, managing to stage a rebound afterwards. At her press conference, Lagarde argued that price pressures remain strong, while services prices are pushed up by pent up demand amidst a strong growth in the sector and in contrast with a worsening outlook for manufacturers. Lagarde also noted that there are still significant upside risks to inflation, which remain bolstered by energy and supply bottlenecks, while wage pressure has gathered further traction as of late. Lagarde reiterated that the bank maintains a meeting-by-meeting approach when it comes to decide on the next moves on rates as well as the performance of inflation and key fundamentals. At the Q&A session,Lagardestressed that all participants agreed that more tightening was needed, while many of them even leant towards a 50 bps hike.

"The GBP/USD pair enters a bullish consolidation and oscillates in a narrow trading range just below its highest level since June 2022 touched this Thursday. The pair holds steady just above the mid-1.2500s through the early North American session, awaiting a fresh catalyst before the next leg of a directional move. In the meantime, a modest US Dollar (USD) recovery from over one-week low acts as a headwind and keeps the GBP/USD pair below the 1.2600 round-figure mark. Signs of stress at another US regional bank, PacWest Bancorp, sparks fears of a full-blown banking crisis in the US, which, along with looming recession risks, temper investors' appetite for riskier assets. This is evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets and helps revive demand for the safe-haven Greenback. The USD bulls, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets in the wake of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) less hawkish outlook. It is worth recalling that the US central bank raised interestratesby 25 bps on Wednesday and opened the door for a possible pause in June. Apart from this, concerns over the US debt ceiling continue to act as a headwind for the US Treasury bond yields, which should further contribute to keeping a lid on the buck and limiting the downside for the GBP/USD pair, at least for now. On the economic data front, the US Initial Weekly Jobless Claims rose more than expected, to 242K during the week ending April 29 from the previous week’s 229K (revised from 230K) and fails to provide any meaningful impetus.
